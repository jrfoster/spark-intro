I went through the standard argument with her, and even though she has some understanding of what prime factorization is, the notion of proof by contradiction was a bit beyond her, and she quickly lost interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tell this story because I think being too rigorous too soon can be damaging to children's enjoyment of mathematics, which may give them a sour taste and never give them the chance to enjoy math later on.

Rigor can come later, when they thirst for it.  If they don't care about the foundations of mathematics right away, and just enjoy looking at nice pictures and doing interesting activities, great, run with that.

Other undergraduates sometimes ask me to tutor them in an introductory real analysis course that covers the equivalent of the first half-dozen chapters of baby Rudin. We meet once a week for about an hour to discuss concepts and their problem sets. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the semester, I seem to spend about half the time on concepts (mainly repeating definitions and giving examples) and the other half giving hints on the homework problems. Later in the semester (and in the second semester continuation), I spend most of the time giving them considerable help with the homework. I don't have any trouble explaining concepts. However, I have a lot of difficultly with providing the appropriate amount of help with problem sets. The biggest problem I see with my students is a lack of problem solving ability. Part of it is a result of a poor grasp on the material and part of it is laziness. They don't seem to be able to think about a problem constructively for more than 5 or 10 minutes before giving up. Further, many of the problems are relatively easy once you see the essential idea or 'trick'. So either I show them the 'trick' or they just get the answer from another student. I usually end up giving too much assistance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have suggested they try easier exercises to build up their problem solving skills. Abbott's &lt;em&gt;Understanding Analysis&lt;/em&gt; is a good source of these. However, they are unwilling to do much extra work on their own. Of course, this is ultimately their problem, but as a busy undergraduate myself, I am sympathetic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another common concern is preparing for exams. A 1-hour exam is a much different format than an untimed problem set and much less forgiving. My standard advice is to first to memorize all of the definitions, be able to give examples and non-examples (where relevant), and memorize the statements of all of the important theorems. After they have done this, I suggest solving easy exercises from their textbook and trying to prove simple propositions in their book without looking at the book's proof (e.g. a finite intersection of open sets in $\mathbb R^n$ is open). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How should I address these issues?

If it's as a foundation for more advanced, abstract concepts, then it would be useful to practice until the more specific example is no longer a hard problem.

The point is not only memorization per se, but the repetitive aspect, which is often misguidedly downplayed in contexts where it is pretended that we all have nearly-perfect memories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In brief: &quot;drill&quot; is pretty inhuman(e), or can be, but has benefits not achievable otherwise.

Doing math is not only about memory, but remembering your definitions and theorems can be crucial to doing problems.

If you want to solve a problem in group theory, you need a good understanding of what a groups is. That is, you need to have memorized the definition and have internalized it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I would say that this is the answer to the question: &quot;&lt;em&gt;What are the advantages of memory-oriented teaching?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.

Then, after a bad answer I respond &quot;unfortunately, this approach will not work in this setting, however this is a perfectly reasonable answer&quot; and then explain why the idea could work (i.e. intuitions, sometimes even explaining similar problems where it does work), and finally I would demonstrate why our current task is different and why that particular method fails.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are particular personalities such that making them ask even a silly question helps. I remember one session where I made the whole class ask clownish things which, then, greatly eased the tension (it transformed into a sort of joke-questions contest) and activated even the most stubborn part of the group (and we did lose a lot of time, but I wouldn't say it was wasted).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a two-three classes it becomes a standard thing and I don't even need to pick them. If someone is behind, it is often enough to apply a very gentle pressure (like a slightly longer eye-contact) to activate him/her. During the semester (i.e. when I earned enough respect) I sometimes taunt/tease them, even to the point of encouraging disobedience (tricking them into independent thoughts), e.g. proposing some bad solutions (sometimes blatantly bad, e.g. for comical effect, sometimes subtly wrong, to guard them against bad intuitions) or saying &quot;no&quot; to perfectly valid inferences (e.g. to emphasize which part of the process was the key part &quot;oh, now I understand&quot;, and perhaps later to recall some previously solved problems &quot;it is the same we did last week&quot; and extract similar patterns, perhaps alike in some unobvious way; or to make the solution more formal and show them some traps which could be overlooked and later lead to incorrect reasoning).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with any approach, there are disadvantages. There was one group which learned that saying &quot;I don't know&quot; is ok too fast and I was basically helpless - the contact was poor, and as things I prepare depend on class participation, they learned less and less, and that, in turn, made them even more remote. I was unable to break from the evil cycle until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that these people start asking many (too many) questions in classes taught by others which makes them (the teachers) angry at you (e.g. it disrupts their flow).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it works better with mature people, i.a. ones which are conscious that it is in their interest to learn, rather than just earn grades. One time such a situation turned itself into really dissonant tones: I scorned a &quot;let-me-show-off&quot; question of a good grade-earner and praised a bit naive, but honest question from person who usually doesn't know what's happening. There were some resentful looks and I had to give the class a much harder challenge so that it would be difficult even for the top part, so that the aforementioned person could reclaim his status, but in the process had to ask honest questions to complete the task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is not the best way, but it works for me (among others, it matches my style of teaching).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps $\ddot\smile$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2014-03-14T19:55:24.663" LastActivityDate="2014-03-14T19:55:24.663" CommentCount="2" />

Also, I can freely encourage my students to post any questions they might have about their homework to math.stackexchange, or to ask other students and professors, and there is no &quot;cheating&quot; issue, since I don't collect the homework, and instead they sincerely want to learn whatever it is they are asking about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="90" LastEditorUserId="90" LastEditDate="2014-03-16T14:40:38.947" LastActivityDate="2014-03-16T14:40:38.947" CommentCount="9" />

My math professor (Rainer Wüst from TU Berlin) had presented the theorem in way which was easier to digest: He started with a function $f$ which is continuous differentiable in a domain $\mathcal G$ in ${\mathbb R}^2$. He writes in his book &quot;an approach which is completely unnessecary, from a mathematical point of view.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can give a geometric interpretation to the assertion of the implicit function theorem, which I'll repeat here in his formulation: If $f(y_0,x_0)=0$ and with some contitions on the partial derivatives, there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $x_0$ and a function $h$ which is continuously differntiable in $V$ with $f(x_0)=y_0$ and $f(h(x),x)=0$ for all $x\in V$.

It isn't enough to pose a question now and again and expect them to suddenly leap in to action to answer it.  So you need to be asking questions consistently through the course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next point I'd like to make is that it will take time for the students to figure out that that is what is expected and to participate (and even longer to enjoy participating).  This has two practical consequences.  The first is that you should expect - and know how to deal with - an initial desire on the part of (most) students to not participate.  The second is that you should think about participation on a continuous scale not as an on/off state, so in the early days ask questions that can be answered almost without thinking and make it easier for the students to answer than not answer.  Then once they know what to expect, you can get them to do the more thoughtful questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A danger that is easy to fall in to with interactive environments is to focus your teaching on those who are interacting.  This is natural, but can back-fire as all the others feel even less involved than they would normally.  If the majority will not start the course feeling like they should interact, the initial interactors are out-liers and you shouldn't be shaping the course by their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the university level, I would start by telling them explicitly what is expected of them, and why.  They are legally adults now and need to start taking responsibility for their own learning.  Then every time I asked them a question, I would remind them of why I'm asking them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On to practicalities.  I'm currently using the &quot;voting&quot; method of asking questions.  I'm teaching a course to non-mathematicians which is very much a techniques course.  So the &quot;I probably didn't understand the question&quot; barrier to answering is quite high.  Add in the fact that I'm not teaching in their native language, and the chance of someone answering a complicated question is quite small.  So I ask simple questions and I get them to vote on them.  Here's what is characteristic about my style (in reference to the points above):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions are &lt;em&gt;really easy&lt;/em&gt;.  Quite frequently, the answer is really obvious, not just mathematically but from the very fact that I'm asking the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I make it clear that guessing is absolutely fine.  I frequently use the example of doing the exam: a guessed answer gives you a chance at some points, no answer gives you no chance.  (I keep quiet about Oscar Wilde's quote about keeping one's mouth shut.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't take &quot;no&quot; for an answer.  I mean, &quot;no participation&quot;.  After not many have voted the first time around, I berate them and ask again.  Then I'll ask &quot;Who didn't vote?&quot;, and &quot;Who didn't say that they didn't vote (but didn't vote)?&quot;.

A workshop is during normal lecture time.  Students are given 3-5 questions that range from conceptual questions to difficult proofs.  We created the groups randomly, and we changed them every few workshops. We gave them whiteboards (you can buy big sheets of whiteboards at home depot for like $5 and have them cut them down for you) and markers, and asked them to work together on the proofs in order.  As the lesson progressed, the TAs and I would walk around the room answering questions and reviewing proofs.  Depending on how many resources you have this could be very difficult, but we decided to split the large lectures down into smaller ones so this was feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MIT: &lt;a href=&quot;http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/fall13/class-material.shtml&quot;&gt;Albert Meyer in 6.042&lt;/a&gt; takes a different approach.  The classes are still smaller, and I believe there are still &quot;lab assistants&quot; running around the room helping out, but he does the flipped classroom every lecture.  He's done it in several different ways over the years.  I believe originally, he gave mini lectures for the first 20ish minutes, and then the students worked for the rest.  He might have moved to asking the students to watch the lectures at home--in a true flipped classroom format--now.  One other thing to note is that the book Albert wrote is absolutely fantastic and completely open.  It's a great resource for good problems, good explanations, and expository material for students to read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stanford:  I can't remember the course number or name right now.

Over the course of the semester there was a fair amount of griping, not about &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; course but about the other courses they were required to take, and in particular about their Abstract Algebra course, which they felt was completely useless for their future careers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At a certain point in the semester we were doing some collaborative lesson planning for a hypothetical set of classes about exponential functions.  Since our Methods class was structured in part around the &quot;backwards design&quot; approach of Wiggins &amp;amp; McTighe, we spent some time at the beginning discussing the &quot;big ideas&quot; of exponential functions.  One of my students proposed as a &quot;big idea&quot; that there was an analogy between exponential growth and linear growth:  in the functions $f(x)=mx+b$ and $g(x)=AB^x$, the coefficient $A$ is analogous to the constant term $b$ (both give the y-intercept or &quot;starting value&quot; for the function) and the exponential base $B$ is analogous to the slope $m$ (both capture the idea of a &quot;constant growth rate&quot;, one additively and one multiplicatively).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After talking about this for a while I said something like:  &quot;You know, there is a precise name for 'analogies' like this.  A mathematician would call it an isomorphism.  In fact what you seem to be saying is that the additive group of real numbers is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers.  In fact the properties of logarithms and exponents -- like $e^{a+b} = e^a  e^b$ and $log(ab)=log(a) + log(b)$ -- really don't say anything more than that the log and exp functions are homomorphisms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my students got one of those &quot;aha&quot; looks and commented that I had just taught her more about abstract algebra in 2 minutes than she learned in an entire semester of the other course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(An even more basic version of this:  Students already know that the rules for multiplying positive and negative numbers are, in a sense, &quot;just like&quot; the rules for adding even and odd numbers.  Abstract algebra provides a language for describing exactly what this &quot;just like&quot; sense means.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My point is that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; ways in which higher-level undergraduate math courses (like abstract algebra) can be directly relevant for teaching secondary mathematics...

That gives you a baseline on how much time someone (you!) who already knows all the questions would take to answer the exam.  This is particularly useful for exams that are writing-heavy (like proofs and &quot;explain this&quot; questions).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) If you have TAs, ask them to take the exam.  Give them some fraction of the time you intend to give the students.  Depending on the topic/course, this could be 1/5, 1/3, 1/2.  Your TAs (arguably) should get near perfect scores on your exams (unless you want a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; difficult question).  Make sure you tell them to actually time themselves and actually write the answers down.  Also, make sure you actually review what they've written.  Once, one of my TAs finished in the time he was given, and I hadn't reviewed his answers.  It turned out (after the students took it) that he'd accidentally answered something incorrectly, and the exam was harder than I had intended.  Ideally, you'd want to use undergraduate TAs for this, if at all possible, because they're &quot;closer&quot; in experience to the students in the course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Try to mark your idea of a &quot;difficulty level&quot; for each question you write on the exam, as you add them.  Generally, the best exams have a combination of &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, and &quot;difficult&quot; questions.  Certainly, if you don't balance this for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; idea of what this means, the exam might end up skewed to one side.  Then, if you have your TAs take it, ask them to rate the questions too.

You raise a kid and accidentally make them smarter than you were. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, ideas spread.

If you want to put a similar question on the exam, take only a certain amount of the time they said (The concept is not new to them; they should be prepared for the exam; plus students normally overestimate the time they needed [Since this seems to be an advanced class, this time should be quite fair].).

A good student should be able to finish the exam in time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use multiple choice questions.

Students engage much more readily when they have an opportunity to take some time to put their thoughts together and to attempt to articulate them in the comparative safety of a one-on-one interaction with a classmate rather than in the full glare of the room's complete attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for questions:&lt;/strong&gt; Ask, &quot;what could a person ask about this?&quot; Or, &quot;what might bother somebody about this?&quot; I often call on a student wearing a befuddled expression and ask, &quot;what's on your mind?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agpa.uakron.edu/p16/btp.php?id=wait-time&quot;&gt;Wait time&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Several people have mentioned the importance of tolerating silence after asking a question, to give students a chance to think. I'd add that, if you going to call on a raised hand, it is important to often not call on the first hand that goes up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://linda103-dailyassignment.blogspot.com/2011/04/daily-assignment-56-dipsticking.html&quot;&gt;Dipsticking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was mentioned by Sue VanHattum. I used to use thumbs-up, thumbs-sideways, thumbs-down as a quick gauge of the class' sense of its understanding, and I think it's great. More recently (since I started with students summarizing, see above), I'm more likely to say, &quot;raise your hand if you think you understand, not necessarily if you buy it, but just if you understand, the last thing that was said.&quot; If less than 3/4 of the hands go up, I ask somebody who raised their hand to summarize the idea for the people who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explicitly encouraging a culture of risk-taking. &lt;strong&gt;Praise all risks.&lt;/strong&gt; When a student asks an honest question, thank them, no matter how obvious the answer seems to you or anyone else. If a student's wrong answer, confusion, question, or expression of doubt leads to the clarification of some point, &lt;em&gt;call everyone's attention to this fact.&lt;/em&gt; Train students to see the value when they and other people are willing to ask their questions and express their thinking, by pointing out this value when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General comment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every single one of the techniques mentioned above slows down the coverage of material. In my experience, they all, always, slow it down &lt;em&gt;more than I think they will&lt;/em&gt;. This makes them hard to implement consistently because of the pressure to get certain topics &quot;done&quot; and/or my enthusiasm to reach a certain goal I was excited about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, when I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; implement them consistently, I am always left with the strong conviction that the extra time was worth it. Often, for example, when dipsticking, or asking for student summaries, I find out that a point I thought I had taught well actually missed everybody. The time spent in discovering this and doing something about it was obviously worth it, because if I had pushed ahead, I would have been pretending the students had learned something they really hadn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I say this to encourage stick-to-it-iveness in broadening your repertoire of techniques to encourage participation, and to be ready to face down the costs to speed of coverage.

Oddly, with the advent of good &quot;math software&quot;, it appears that much of what was done by hand by engineers a few decades ago is essentially programmable...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; proposing that &quot;rigorous proof&quot; is not the highest goal in mathematics, although, of course, knowing with greater certainty is desirable. Making implicit assumptions overt is good methodology. But being paranoid about technicalities is not good methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A riff I use to explain to the best undergrads I see is that undergrad classes are essentially worthless as preparation for grad school, and the first-year grad courses are scarcely better. That is, quasi-ironically, &quot;we&quot; train beginners into a behavior pattern that we often seemingly endorse for them, but which is not at all what we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is, the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of &quot;logical perfection&quot; in mathematics, unlike most other venues, inordinately catches our collective fancies, and become a goal in its own right.

Better if one can survive in relatively gentle graduate courses, even if they have degenerated (as is often so) into laundry-lists of must-mention topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words: mathematics is far simpler than as portrayed in undergrad courses.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Best to become acquainted with basics privately and efficiently, unless one truly needs the carrot-and-stick thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="63" LastActivityDate="2014-03-14T23:29:01.230" CommentCount="8" />

An easy way of thinking about it is that someone who has been studying mathematics for a very long time has likely forgotten the struggles she went through when she initially learned the material.  This can make it very difficult to understand the issues that students have and why they have them.  It often presents itself in the feeling &quot;This is trivial!

Students often respond to this with something like &quot;but that's just assuming the conclusion!&quot;, because internally they aren't fixing $n$ to be a &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; natural number--to them, it's more intuitive to just assume it for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; natural number.

Someone else might assume that the bijection between $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ and functions from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\{0,1\}$ that uses binary is trivial to students who might be new to bijections or never have seen binary before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ignoring &quot;Trivial&quot; Steps.&lt;/em&gt; Another very common issue is that instructors sometimes accidentally leave out steps or details (because they view them as &quot;obvious&quot;).  Someone who has been differentiating functions for a very long time might not explicitly call attention to uses of the chain rule, product rule, etc.  It's often an oversight rather than the intention.

The reason I posted it here is that talent (i.e. mathematical gift) plays a much greater role in thinking-heavy areas than in, for example, biology or history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The university welcomes all kinds of students with varying degree of mathematical/programming ability. They are split into groups of 15 (approximately), however, to teach the beginners programming and to keep the experienced engaged, each such group might be &quot;imperative&quot; (beginners learn some standard programming language) or &quot;functional&quot; (those who could code before learn some functional language). There is a test of their programming skill and then students are assigned accordingly to the results (if student wishes and there are no obstacles, he may apply for a change; in the past there was no test and the students could pick the group type as they wished). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summarizing: there are several &quot;imperative&quot; groups which contain mostly beginners and a few &quot;functional&quot; groups which include students that could code before. It is worth noting that the majority of the gifted students would usually participate in programming contests in high school, while the average and below-average students almost always can't code (even if they know the syntax, the test is too hard for them). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This works quite well: with such a split the beginners learn the basics, while students from &quot;functional&quot; groups are engaged because of the more advanced topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This works quite well, until the exams. The groups motivate/demotivate themselves internally and in result mediocre students from the &quot;functional&quot; groups have learned a way more than the good from the &quot;imperative&quot; groups. &#xA;It wouldn't be a big problem, because the results between &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;imperative&quot; groups are incomparable - the tests are of incomparable difficulty, hence are graded separately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, as the schedules are inter-dependent, the groups formed there are kept also for other courses, i.e. these which didn't plan for a split at all. Again, groups motivate themselves internally (and also teachers are more engaged with brighter students), but this time all the students are graded according to the same key. The gap in performance is disastrous: the average score for the first group might be easily over $80\%$, while the average for the rest can be as low as $25\%$. Such results have impact on their learning, motivation and many other things, but most importantly, a big part that would attend the &quot;imperative&quot; would fail their exams and sometimes even drop out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One could think that splitting the students by abilities is just a bad solution. On the other hand, their knowledge and experience varies so much that it would be impossible to keep all the parties interested. For example, this happens for electable courses, where the groups mix together, and pose a serious challenge for the teachers. It is so inconvenient that professors happen to make their optional classes intentionally very hard or very easy (the funny part is that it even feels natural, because those courses are in majority theoretical and practical respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure that it's not a healthy state of affairs, but this is a hard problem and might lack a general solution.

But I'd like to point out some arguments in favor of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; including any construction of the real numbers (like Dedekind cuts or limits of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences), and simply stating the axioms which are needed for the rest of the course.  (This may or may not include stating a theorem that there is, up to an appropriate notion of isomorphism, a unique mathematical structure satisfying those axioms.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You note that the introduction of the real numbers is the most difficult part of many analysis textbooks.  Beyond that, I would say that it is in many ways orthogonal to the rest of the course.  The mathematical issues and techniques involved in &lt;em&gt;defining&lt;/em&gt; the real numbers are mostly rather different from the issues and techniques involved in &lt;em&gt;working with&lt;/em&gt; the real numbers.  Therefore time and effort spent on defining the real numbers doesn't actually contribute much to students' understanding of real analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also raise the point that omitting a definition of the real numbers &quot;does not align with the deductive structure of mathematics.&quot;  But you have to start with &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.  Most constructions of the real numbers start with the rational numbers.  But what are those?  Rational numbers can be defined starting from the integers; this construction (and its generalization to integral domains) is frequently taught in algebra courses.  But what are the integers?  They can be constructed from the natural numbers, which can be constructed in pure set theory…  Most people wouldn't think of starting an analysis class with the Peano axioms, let alone axiomatic set theory.  (And how many people teaching analysis classes, or writing analysis texts, are even qualified to teach axiomatic set theory?)  So an analysis class starts somewhere higher up the ladder, with a lot of structure assumed to be familiar to the students.  This admittedly &quot;does not align with the deductive structure of mathematics,&quot; but that's a necessary fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, the last time I taught analysis I covered Dedekind cuts, because it seemed to let me get to the real content of the course more quickly than Cauchy sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="129" LastActivityDate="2014-03-15T12:28:38.017" CommentCount="1" />

Below my take on the Cauchy sequences approach (mainly in favor to complement the other answer).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The approach of constructing the real numbers as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers modulo sequences with limit zero seems certainly not like the most intuitive one or the one most in line with earlier concepts, but it does not that bad in this regard either, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has some other advantages. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the advantages (in my mind):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One uses objects and notions that one needs later on, such as: Cauchy sequences, sequences with limit zero, the notion of an equivalence relation in a somewhat non-trivial way, definining operations (sum and product) on the spaces of sequences, checking some operation stays well defined under that equivalence relation. By contrast, a Dedekind cut seems completely confined to this context; granted some of the things I mention also come up in that context but still I feel it is more useful to have it for sequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach generalizes. The same approach of constructing a completion works for any metric spaces. More generally, if one wants, one can use such a course to build up some basic notions of General Topology.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it is not that bad regarding intuition:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the most intuitive sem-rigorous way to think of a real (non-rational) number is as a sequence of (rational) numbers that approach it in some sense. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one has an algorithm to calculate ever better approxiamtions, this would fit this intuition. Perhaps one has &quot;the decimal expansion&quot;, this would fit this intuition. Perhaps one has a sequence of ever smaller intervalls containing the number, this would essentially also fit this intuition (considering end-points). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, then,  from a certain point on one should never be too far away from what one wants to approach, whence the Cauchy criterion. And, if a sequecne goes to zero, then it &quot;is&quot;  zero. And, two things are &quot;equal&quot; if the difference is zero.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the problem of what to assume.&lt;/strong&gt; Two possible arguments. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is a point to be made that to assume the rationals but to construct the reals is apt for an Analysis course since the real numbers are in some sense an object of the analytic world. By contrast, in the evoked context often, another, possibly the other, large course followed by students is some (Linear) Algebra course. There they will also use real numbers more often then not working in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and so on, but it is hardly ever really relevant, so I would say to make a 'big deal' in that context about what the real numbers are would feel besides the point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; start earlier. Starting from (naive) set theory one can build up 'everything', introducing students to proofs by induction and some related things on the way. (For example Schwartz's 'Analyse I' is subtitled set theory and topologie.) If this is feasible depends on the context. In some classical curricula there would be essentially Anaysis 1,2,3,4 spanning the first two years, often thaught by one and the same instructor. In such a context one has quite a bit of flexibility at the start and to start with set thoery, Peano axioms and so on is viable. If the students should know some actual analysis after the first term, then of course less so. I would likely not do it myself even in the former conext, but I was taught it like this: I enjoyed it, many others did not. &#xA;And, this level of (naive) set theory feels then really like something of a natural baseline as it is this level on which many mathematicians actually build/operate. (Perhaps this is an over generalisation, and things are also changing in this regard but I think that this is/was a justification for such choices.)      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are disadvantages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of time while not being that central/useful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not that easy to follow and some students might find it boring or pointless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning an argument in favor around.

That is, you don't demonstrate the existence of any number system that satisfies the given axioms.  I think #1 is probably the best if a course is short on time, or if the students aren't mathematically sophisticated enough to benefit from seeing one of the constructive definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Approach #2 is what the students are expecting, but unfortunately the details are quite cumbersome, and the construction is not very natural (since it depends on a choice of base).   It also doesn't give the students much new insight into the nature of the real numbers---it just fills in the details of insight they already have.  In my opinion, the only reason to use #2 is if you are independently interested in talking about decimal expansions, e.g. if most of the students in the class are future high-school teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Approach #3 is quite simple and elegant, and is certainly the easiest of the constructive approaches.  It's wonderfully intuitive, and really cements in the students minds the idea that the real numbers are obtained by &quot;filling in&quot; holes in the rational number line.  The disadvantage of this approach is that it's primarily order-theoretic: students are unlikely to see a construction like this again unless they study order theory, so it might be better to use an approach that's connected to other things the students will be learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Approach #4 is complicated, but has three main advantages (1) Students in a real analysis course should probably learn about Cauchy sequences anyway, so the extra time isn't exactly wasted (2) It starts the course off by identifying sequences as the important thing, a theme that is likely to continue for the rest of the course (3) It is a construction that can be generalized to completions of arbitrary metric spaces, which is something that students will need to understand when they learn point-set topology or advanced analysis.  The disadvantage, of course, is that this is certainly the most complicated of the four options, and some students will be completely mystified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My opinion is that the choice of approach should be based on the audience and the nature of the course.  No matter what, I think it's worth pointing out that the other approaches exist, and perhaps briefly discussing them in class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So here's what I think:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a one-semester course in real analysis, it's probably best to stick with an axiomatic approach.  There are more important topics to cover than constructions of the real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a two-semester course in real analysis for typical math majors, it probably makes sense to use either Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences.  For average students, I think Cauchy sequences are a bit too difficult, so I would start with Dedekind cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a two-semester course in real analysis for future mathematicians (i.e. student planning to go to Ph.D. programs), I would recommend covering &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Cauchy sequences and Dedekind cuts, as well as mentioning the other two approaches.  This audience will benefit a lot from the Cauchy sequences approach, but they should also know about other possible approaches, since they may be teaching real analysis themselves one day!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an analysis course aimed at future high-school teachers, I would think it would be a good idea to discuss the decimal number system a bit at the beginning.  Depending on the length of the course, it might also be helpful to discuss Dedekind cuts and/or the axiomatic approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One final note: if you do use the axiomatic approach, there is still some choice in which version of completeness you include as an axiom.  The tradition seems to be to use the least upper bound property, but I think there is good reason to use either the convergence of Cauchy sequences or the nested closed intervals property instead.  The advantages of using a Cauchy-sequence-based axiom should be obvious, while the advantages of the nested closed intervals property are that it doesn't require any preliminary definitions, it connects well to notions of compactness, and it is perhaps the easiest of the three to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastEditorUserId="143" LastEditDate="2014-03-15T21:40:55.673" LastActivityDate="2014-03-15T21:40:55.673" CommentCount="0" />

What follows is some strategies I've tried and how well they worked (or didn't work!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group Work.&lt;/strong&gt; Asking the students to do group work (either in class or on the homework), and assigning groups can really help this issue.  Imagine that you ensure the groups are mixed between the less experienced and more experienced groups; so, you force the students to get to know others.  A couple things happen when you do this.  The first is that they realize even if they're different skill levels at programming, they share other interests, and you can often foster friendships between the groups which helps a lot.  The second is that if you explicitly reward the experienced students who guide and help the unexperienced ones, and reward the unexperienced students who ask questions, you really do close the gap somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Varied Difficulty on the Homework.&lt;/strong&gt;  You can write homeworks where the students don't have to complete every question.  Instead, they can complete several more rudimentary questions or one difficult one.  This helps the weaker students get better at the basics, and it keeps the stronger ones from getting bored.  If you were really brave, you could try doing something like this on the exams, but I'd suspect you'd end up with most students doing the easy questions to maximize their score.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Credit.&lt;/strong&gt; Extra credit is another way of keeping the interest of the stronger students without helping the weaker ones.  I have often give difficult problems (with no credit whatsoever) and the interested students would come to me to talk about them.  One way I implemented this that I think worked really well was that the &quot;participation&quot; part of your grade could be achieved by coming to office hours to talk about slightly more advanced topics.  I found a mix of very weak and very strong students were all interested.

Try to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that a counterexample can &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exist. Think about why you are unable to prove the nonextistence.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Depending on context.) Keep an open mind. Perhaps if you really cannot find a counterexample it is because there really is none. This happens. A famous case is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleson%27s_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Carelson's theorem&lt;/a&gt;, he first tried to find  counterexamples to what is now his theorem (then Luzin's conjecture) but eventually got convinced there is none and proved this.

Then, in the beginning of the 1960s, I suddenly realized that I knew exactly why there had to be a counterexample and how one should construct one. Somehow, the trigonometric system is the type of system where it is easiest to provide counterexamples. Then I could prove that my approach was impossible. I found out that this idea would never work; I mean that it couldn’t work. If there were a counterexample for the trigonometric system, it would be an exception to the rule. Then I decided that maybe no one had really tried to prove the converse. From then on it only took two years or so. But it is an interesting example of &quot;to prove something hard, it is extremely important to be convinced of what is right and what is wrong.&quot; You could never do it by alternating between the one and the other because the conviction somehow has to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="143" LastActivityDate="2014-03-15T16:42:45.777" CommentCount="1" />

Here's a quick outline of a few:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Many lectures consist of worked examples from the book.  These can be helpful for students who are confused, but, often times, students convince themselves that they can just read the book.  For some of them, this works out, but for others, they are completely unable to recover.  A nice, easy way of dealing with this is to survey the class on how they feel about this type of lecture.  If they all say &quot;they don't find it useful&quot;, that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it---just that you might consider mixing it up more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Another type of lecture in a proofs-based class is to just write up solutions to proofs.  This can be really tedious for the students--and worse, it can make them feel like they're learning when they're actually just mechanically writing down what's on the board.  Since they believe the &quot;value&quot; of these lectures is the notes, students will often ask their friends to write notes for them and just copy them (or not!) later.  This can be even worse when instructors give out typeset notes to the students.  One way of mitigating this is to intersperse the proofs themselves with other content--like explanations of how and why things are the way they are.  I've also found that giving students notes that they can follow through the lecture and explicitly downplaying the importance of the content of the proof itself helps students realize that just copying someone else's notes isn't particularly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="93" LastActivityDate="2014-03-15T17:15:04.863" CommentCount="0" />

But, if you are to give it attention, it is probably worth-while going through the equivalence of the principle of induction and the well-ordering of the naturals. In fact, when I teach induction I proceed as follows: Suppose an inductive property does not hold for all naturals. Look at the set of counter-examples, and pick the smallest one. Arrive at a contradiction and conclude the property did hold for all naturals. I find that this approach is very natural (pun not intended). The equivalent formalism of prove case $k=1$, then prove $P(k)\implies P(k+1)$ is something I only introduce later. For the life of me I don't understand why this formalism is the standard one and not the &quot;look at all counter-example....&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is probably also a good idea to talk about the status of the principle of induction. It is not a theorem but rather a proof principle. It is ok not to accept it (though most mathematicians do). It is important to understand that what we accept by proof by induction is that a single recipe for proofs (i.e., for each $k$ we have a recipe for how to concoct a proof for $P(k)$) is accepted as a single proof for an infinitude of statement (i.e., all the $P(k)$ for all natural $k$).

This motivates the definition of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_relation&quot;&gt;congruence relation&lt;/a&gt;, and I show that the equivalence classes for a congruence relation form a group.  This mirrors the approach that is usually taken for defining modular arithmetic, and so immediately connects the two in the students' minds.  It also has the advantage that the definition seems fairly natural.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I then go on to observe that the congruence class of the identity must be a subgroup that is closed under conjugation, which prompts the definition of a normal subgroup.  I also point out to the students that congruence relations aren't used very often in group theory, since all you really need to know for making a quotient is the normal subgroup (although group theorists often use the notation $gN = hN$ when they want to say that $g$ and $h$ are congruent).  I do homomorphisms a bit later on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I were prohibited from using this approach, I think I would start by introducing homomorphisms, and then observe that the kernel of a homomorphism is a subgroup that is closed under conjugation, prompting the definition of a normal subgroup.

Write a program that will pick the guests so that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;no guest would meet their immediate superior at the party,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;the sum of sociability coefficients is maximal,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;the company founder (the root of the tree) has to be at the party.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The program should output a single number, namely the sum of sociability coefficients of the guests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm to calculate it is easy, let the symbol $\mathcal{T}$ denote the set of abstract people with their hierarchies&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;\begin{align*}&#xA;\newcommand{soc}{\mathtt{sociability}}&#xA;\newcommand{sub}{\mathtt{subordinates}}&#xA;\newcommand{with}{\mathtt{with}}&#xA;\newcommand{without}{\mathtt{without}}&#xA;\soc &amp;amp;: \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}^+\\&#xA;\sub &amp;amp;: \mathcal{T} \to 2^\mathcal{T} \\&#xA;\end{align*}&#xA;then in mathematical notation it would be&#xA;\begin{align*}&#xA;\with(t)&amp;amp;= \soc(t) + \sum_{s\ \in\ \sub(t)} \without(s), \\&#xA;\without(t) &amp;amp;= \sum_{s\ \in\ \sub(t)} \max\big\{ \with(s), \without(s) \big\}.&#xA;\end{align*}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where the result will be given by $\with$ as the founder has to be included. Now, the challenge is to prove that it is optimal (i.e. it returns the correct result). The proof is via induction on the structure of the tree, that is, we start from leaves and then go up to the root, with the assumption that each time when make the step in some node, all its subtrees are already done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The base step is easy, as for each leaf we have $\sub(l) = \varnothing$ so&#xA;\begin{align}\with(l) &amp;amp;= \soc(l) \\&#xA;\without(l) &amp;amp;= 0 \end{align} what is obviously true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the induction step, $\with(t)$ requires all the subtrees to skip their roots, and besides that they are all independent, so we can just take the sociability of $t$ and add all the optimal subsolutions (we can use them because of the induction hypothesis) and that is exactly what the formula is doing. As for $\without(t)$ the $t$ itself isn't a guest, so from each subtree we can pick the best option and sum it all together. This works, but only because we know that the subsolutions were calculated correctly from induction hypothesis, the shape of the tree ensures, that there weren't any circular arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes students benefit from an alternative proof: take an optimal solution and prove that one returned by the algorithm isn't worse. Again, prove it via induction on the structure of the tree, the hypothesis being that our algorithm returns an optimal subsolution for each node of the tree. Base case is easy, because there is no choice available in the leaves. For the inner nodes we show that our algorithm returns a pick of guests at least as good as the optimal solution (in $\with$ it follows from induction hypothesis and the fact that all the numbers are positive, for $\without$ it follows from properties of $\max$ function).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some commentary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each time I did this it was an introductory course in programming, and for many the first time where they would see a non-linear induction (in fact this &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be proved with induction on the height of the tree, but I did complicate it on purpose). Drawing a diagram with arrows, describing how the induction progresses and how it relies on the subtrees being already calculated helps a lot. After this exercise the topic would come back again several times and students would have much easier time proving that some algorithm (e.g. the Ackermann function)  terminates. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is hard to draw any reliable conclusions from this experience (it might be just a coincidence that it worked for me), so it would be great if someone could test it themselves.

I do spend about 30% of the lecture time on proofs and I start with the axioms of the real numbers and some discussion of basic topology on the real line. I teach primarily from my notes and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to teach as I am given the invariable decline of the students with time. As it currently stands, I have been able to attract some excellent students with our calculus. They like the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trigonometry:&lt;/strong&gt; many of them have been taught with calculators. Others not at all. Generally speaking there is a lot of ignorance about things they ought not need think hard about: $\sin(0)=0$, $\cos(0)=1$, graphs of sine, cosine, tangent. I just gave a physics (calculus-based, so these kids have already been through calculus) where no one could solve $0.8\sin \theta + \cos \theta = 1.2$. More generally, the problem is the bar is set too low in the previous courses. I suspect they are taught to solve standard problems rather than being taught how to think. Have they ever encountered a problem on an exam which was not in homework? Is that even on the table? Were they expected to take notes or just to fill in some template? Was homework done at home or in class? These are all factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;set notation, reading definitions, original thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; I've touched on this in 1. already, but it deserves it's own point. When I teach calculus I make a point of giving definitions. The student is expected to read it and use it. I see students totally shut-down when I ask a really simple question which requires nothing more than reading the set-builder notation and literally some number-line thinking. They go hunting for a problem like that, so they can follow the guide. This is a problem. The books we use teach them problem solving strategies as opposed to helping them think for themselves. I realize babies need milk, but at some point you gotta start to chew. Sooner would be better for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False confidence.&lt;/strong&gt; Some students have taken a highshcool calculus before where it was mostly symbol-pushing. Well, I still make them push symbols around, but there is much more analysis involved. Can they actually write mathematics? As in , use sentences to explain what they are doing. Often, I spend a lot of ink on the first test just trying to communicate to them that they must connect the equations properly. To summarize, if getting the answer was sufficient in their previous course then it's an uphill battle when they get to my class and I tell them that the answer is the whole argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="128" LastEditorUserId="128" LastEditDate="2014-03-17T05:05:49.293" LastActivityDate="2014-03-17T05:05:49.293" CommentCount="6" />

Because it's very common in mathematics that you don't know the answer to a question, but you can make a lot of progress by &lt;em&gt;guessing&lt;/em&gt; the answer and then trying to prove it.  If there's a sequence that you're trying to understand, and the first few terms are $1,2,4,8,16$, then the obvious thing to do is to try to prove that the $n$th term is equal to $2^n$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a special case of the critically important skill of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pattern recognition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is necessary for solving almost any difficult problem.

The problem with it is that they have their quirks and for many it is counter-intuitive that any open interval is of uncountable size. On the other hand, there are many other objects with which the Cantor's diagonal argument works as well (sometimes it works even better). To name a few:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Infinite binary sequences, functions $\mathbb{N} \to 2$ or $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. We define $g(k) = f_k(k) \oplus 1$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unbounded functions $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$. We define $g(k) = f_k(k)+k+1$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Strictly increasing functions $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$. We define $g(k) = \max_{i = 0}^{k}f_i(k)+1$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Infinite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$. We sort them and proceed as with strictly increasing functions/sequences.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make the appearance even stronger, make the case how any natural number contains a finite amount of information (e.g. you can write it down in finite, even if arbitrarily long time), while some of the above objects hold infinite amount of information (functions/sequences $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ are perfect for this). This could be done by show how you can take any finite amount of information from it, and it is still the same (in a sense):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if you take some bits from natural number, it will get smaller, and eventually, after finite number of steps, &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; decrease to zero,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;similar thing happens to sequences which have only finitely many non-zero entries,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;on the other hand, if you truncate some prefix from a sequence of infinite support, the rest still retains an infinite amount of information.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you can move to reals, perhaps using continued fractions (where rationals are exactly the fractions of finite length), or some other methods and show that there are at least as many reals as the aforementioned objects. Then, you could make an analogy between truncating the prefix and taking an arbitrarily small open interval. Also, note that we take bits of information from the element itself, not the set. For example the set of rationals would still look similar after we would take some elements from it, but no rational number would keep all its information after truncating some of its bits. On the other hand, there are some real numbers which could be written down completely, but more importantly there are those which wouldn't fit on any piece of paper ever. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the numbers which make $\mathbb{R}$ uncountable are inaccessible to us, because as humans we can write down only finite strings and it's not enough. This changes if we had an access to an alphabet of uncountable size, e.g. by assuming that the world and our behavior is continuous and specifying the number as the length between two dots drawn on a sheet of paper. However, this gets disturbingly close to philosophy, so I shall not continue further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps $\ddot\smile$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastActivityDate="2014-03-17T01:22:30.147" CommentCount="2" />

The language of category theory is very helpful because it (IMO) provides a nice general approach to various definitions/ In category theory we have general definitions of products of objects and this in the category of sets becomes the usual Cartesian product. You can then show how your definition one is a way to concretely define a product in that category. But this also extends well to, for example, the product of topological spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When can you start introducing this? Some mathematicians (my self included) wish that they had been introduced to category theory earlier than they were. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, it is hard to get a grasp on categories without looking at examples.

Here again the second definition is helpful to when trying to understand why prime numbers are so important.

But as an exercise in abstraction, I would think that you could get something good out of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think another example of this is the question of whether or not you could introduce group theory in high school. I think you can, but again it isn't easy because it is hard to give good examples.

If you want to motivate abstract algebra, you could start by discussing the operations you can perform with numbers. You can show that under multiplication, only $1$ and $-1$ have inverses in the natural numbers. But in the rational numbers all non-zero numbers have multiplicative inverses. This all leads very naturally to the definition of groups, rings, and fields.

Typically, each weekly homework assignment has at least one problem of this variety, and I've written many like this for assignments and a text. Some thoughts about your posed questions and other ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Does this help? I think yes in several ways, but it's hard to tell. I don't put questions like these on exams, so the &quot;becoming a better proof-reader&quot; skill is something I expect students to pick up from the course, but it is not a major component on which they are assessed. I think that working on these exercises makes them better readers of their own work, but it seems nearly impossible to find a way to quantify or track this progress. I'm also not sure whether students are aware of whether these exercises are helpful. Many might see them as silly (&quot;If we know it's wrong, why bother reading it?&quot;), so I like to follow them up with a &quot;Fix the proof, or give a counterexample to show why the claim is wrong&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Other strategies? Not really, short of reminding and encouraging them &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; to do so. One idea, though: I've recently started devoting a bit of class time to discussing printouts that have actual student-written proofs from recent assignments. (I attached no names, but some students opted to share when it was their proof being discussed.) I noticed a very positive response from students after this, but I think this is because they're very curious about what the others are doing, and I'm not necessarily sure this will make them better readers of their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; work. Still, I plan on repeating this kind of activity more and more often, and tweaking it to get a better understanding of what they get out of it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Too many of these &quot;find the flaw&quot; problems are constructed by choosing a common error (dividing by zero, square-rooting an expression that is later evaluated to be negative, etc) and &lt;em&gt;burying&lt;/em&gt; that error under symbolism and/or verbiage. This is unfortunate, and most students will then approach these problems from the viewpoint of, &quot;Okay, I just need to know the right trick here&quot;. So, I've tried to come up with more interesting exercises that either (a) are based on actual student errors observed in the past, or (b) incorporate a flaw that's based on currently-learned material. For example, I have a &quot;fun&quot; problem that attempts to prove $\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}} \mathcal{P}(\{1,2,\dots,k\}) = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ (where $\mathcal{P}(S)$ is the power set of $S$). This one works out quite well because, usually, the students have trouble at first seeing why the claim is false; once I prod them into thinking about that (and disproving it with an example), they spot the error more easily.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Students have a strong tendency to merely disprove the claim, and not identify any logical/mathematical error in a proof. Sometimes, this can be obvious, even to them, but other times they get so twisted in their explanation of what went wrong that they end up writing a whole paragraph just to say, &quot;This conclusion is wrong because ...&quot;  So if we go over these examples in class, I assume the role of the very stubborn yet erroneous proof-writer; I pretend that I am totally convinced my proof is right, and they have to work hard to show me &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I'm wrong, and not just &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; I'm wrong.

The event that the data falls exactly halfway between the rounding points is now of positive probability, if $\lambda$ is even. (If $\lambda$ is odd, there's no halfway point.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But there are other subtleties in rounding rules: for physical science and statistical analysis, we want the rounding rules to be stable under addition of small random noise, so that we don't introduce rounding artifacts. In statistics the &quot;round to the nearest even integer&quot; rule for tie-breaking is useful, under the assumptions that &#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;we intend to sum/average our data&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the ones-digit of the data is uniformly distributed, at least in terms of evens and odds, and that the distribution is &lt;em&gt;independent of&lt;/em&gt; the digits after the decimal point, which&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;we assume again to be uniformly distributed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are times however our data is multiplicative. In this case rounding from the half-way point is no longer appropriate: it is more appropriate to round $0.3$ down and $0.4$ up. The exact dividing line is $\frac{1}{10} \sqrt{10}$ which conveniently happens to be an irrational number, so in finite precision computations the problem with the tie-breaking rules are side-stepped somewhat. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main point being that the correct rounding rules depend at least on &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A priori assumptions on your data: where they come from, what noises are inherent, what are reasonable &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; probability distributions of the digits...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What you intend to do with those data: are they to be summed? are they to be multiplied? are they to be binned (&lt;em&gt;thank to &lt;a href=&quot;http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/users/60/sue-vanhattum&quot;&gt;Sue VanHattum&lt;/a&gt; for pointing out this case&lt;/em&gt;)? Some more complicated functions? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And a proper discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of different rounding rules will necessarily involve quite some bit of statistics and mathematical modeling. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is, however, not to say that there are not portions of the theory that can be taught to elementary schoolers. But one has to be very careful about the presentation: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You do not want it to devolve into a discussion of &quot;different conventions&quot;. As this just makes two different things that the poor kid will have to memorise, instead of just one. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The issue of tie-breaking rules never occur when dealing with a single datum. Are you sure the kids can appreciate that rounding errors can accumulate when one works with many data points and that this is undesirable? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me give one more try about the theory:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way to think about rounding (or approximations in general) is that we have some space of objects $X$ which are sometimes hard to deal with, but within it we have a subspace of objects $Y$ which are easier to handle. We also have a family of maps $\mathcal{F} = \{F_1, F_2, \ldots\}$ which are maps from some finite Cartesian power of $X$ to $X$ itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt; rounding rule is a map $\mathcal{R}:X \to Y$ (which induces also $\mathcal{R}_k: X^k \to Y^k$ by acting on components) such that &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is idempotent: $\mathcal{R}\circ \mathcal{R} = \mathcal{R}$. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It &quot;commutes&quot; with the family $\mathcal{F}$: for every $i$, suppose that $F_i: X^{k_i} \to X$, then &#xA;$$ \mathcal{R} \circ F_i \circ \mathcal{R}_{k_i} = \mathcal{R} \circ F_i $$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would mean that we can approximate computations (actions of the family $\mathcal{F}$) on $X$ by computations in $Y$ with no ill effects, up to some well-defined finite error. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reality finding such a rounding function $\mathcal{R}$ can be very hard. Consider just the rounding of real numbers ($X = \mathbb{R}$) to integers ($Y = \mathbb{Z}$). No tie-breaker rule for the half-way rounding commutes with simple addition. So we often, in applications, relax the &quot;commutation&quot; rule by asking that it be satisfied for &quot;generic&quot; data, so that only very unlikely outliers will cause the commutation rule to break down. But to understand the notion of generic and to get a quantitative understanding of how badly the commutation rule can break requires some knowledge in probability and statistics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="125" LastEditorUserId="125" LastEditDate="2014-03-17T16:25:34.957" LastActivityDate="2014-03-17T16:25:34.957" CommentCount="8" />

But this argument is stronger than it looks on the surface - the reason the historical trajectory took the path that it did is because, in general, that's often what it means to do mathematics. When confronted with a new and unsolved problem, one of the ways that we make progress on the problem is to impose some assumptions on the problem (e.g. special cases) and solve the more constrained problem. Only after playing in this sandbox for a while does the general solution emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second, more practical, argument is related: by presenting the general solution up front, students are robbed of the need for it and it just becomes another formula to memorize because the teacher said so. On the other hand, by starting with the special cases, students will soon run into quadratics that do not factor. The limitations of the techniques used in the special cases can motivate the need for the general solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="193" LastActivityDate="2014-03-17T11:19:21.997" CommentCount="3" />

Certainly &quot;the new math&quot; did not warm people up to the traditional trigonometry, calculus, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A more insidious problem was that few of the elementary-ed teachers (nor middle-school, nor high-school) had prior preparation in such stuff, ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, of course, if there were room in the curriculum for it, and if kids were ready for it developmentally, &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; some sort of &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;algorithms&quot; could be taught.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there's neither room in the curriculum, nor (in my observation) are kids ready for more conceptual things at that point.

The homework and exams were mostly about execution of algorithms rather than &quot;proofs&quot;, but/and &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt;, at least some sort of &lt;em&gt;narrative&lt;/em&gt; was required. Coping with students' incredulity (&quot;the symbols speak for themselves!&quot; ?!?!) was time-consuming and frustrating, but seemed worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did distribute &quot;approved solutions&quot; as models for what kind of writing-out was desired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, each term, there was a &quot;writing project&quot; required. We did not do revisions... since I usually had 100 students in a class... but/and by the end of the term most of the kids were catching on to writing in English rather than math-eze. In fact, it was gratifying that the issue shifted a bit from &quot;coherent writing&quot; to &quot;what is plagiarism, versus using sources...&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This was quite a lot more work than for &quot;standard&quot; math courses, and the other people now teaching these courses have reverted to more typical structure...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is indeed hard to communicate the idea that mathematics should be imbedded in natural language, to populations who've been conditioned by typical k-12 that the goal is usually a number-in-a-box, and even &quot;showing your work&quot; is a crazy luxury of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point of having people write about their execution of algorithms was &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; originally to have people write about more down-to-earth activities (as opposed to the stylized &quot;proof&quot; notion). I discovered to my dismay that many or most had at least initial difficulty getting the verbal part and the computational part of their brains to cooperate... it seemed. That is, in some amazing cases, people were unable (or maybe merely balked...) to say in words what they were doing in some computation, and/or why they chose one thing over another, and so on. Surprisingly subverbal or non-verbal... An example was to explain how someone knew that $15$ factors into primes as $3\cdot 5$. One kid I recall could say &quot;it's obvious&quot;, and could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; say what they'd do if the number were large enough that a factorization was not &quot;obvious&quot; to them. (This in the days after discussion of trial division and so on... certainly not in a vacuum...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the whole, it seemed beneficial to push students to write coherently, but took much more effort to give useful feedback... and with the ambient curriculum collapsing back to non-verbal mathematics (or stylized math-English), it was somewhat a quixotic battle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At my university there is nowadays a &quot;writing-intensive&quot; requirement, but it is isolated in the math curriculum and viewed as a tiresome burden.

The actual math is mostly guided, with some open-ended questions and extra credit available. I tell students to meet with me while they're working, to make sure they're on the right track, and they &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; ask something like, &quot;How am I supposed to write about this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pasted below are the guidelines I put in the project descriptions. I've found them to be somewhat helpful as general guidelines, but they still require the students to think about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; themselves need to say and how to say it. But this is part of the goal of the project, anyway. Mostly, I just keep stressing this for them: &quot;Put yourself in the shoes of a classmate reading your paper. Would you learn from it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've found the results to be generally quite good, actually! I think this is partly because this experience is new for them, so they just have to think about it more. I also think this is because (most of them) they do come to me and ask about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some things that need improvement ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's tough to get the students to &lt;em&gt;qualitatively&lt;/em&gt; describe things. Often, they write about their work by &quot;translating&quot; the steps into wordy sentences that actually don't complement the accompanying equations. Similarly, they'll include a graph with little description or one plotted on an ill-fitted scale. I think this reflects a general trend that the students (particularly at into calculus college level) still view their work as entirely &lt;em&gt;quantitative&lt;/em&gt; in nature. I try to address this in class by describing my own heuristic/qualitative views whenever they're applicable, but it's tough to address this phenomenon head on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also think they do very little editing. Once they figure out the right steps and write a description of it, they're done with that part and move on. Without seeing their works in progress, I cannot verify this, and can only guess based on final outputs. Furthermore, I wonder if this just reflects a broader trend of poor writing skills gained from current education. (I actively combat this in my &quot;intro to proofs&quot; course, but that course is much more heavily devoted to developing writing skills, as a whole.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In the following pages, I will provide a list of projects for you to&#xA;  choose from, for the month of March.

You will write your results and discoveries&#xA;  in the form of a &quot;research&quot; paper that describes the steps in solving&#xA;  your particular problem, some reasons as to why it is interesting and&#xA;  related to what we've done in class, and a description of what you&#xA;  learned and what you found useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You will be graded not only on the &lt;em&gt;correctness&lt;/em&gt; of your work, but&#xA;  also the &lt;em&gt;clarity&lt;/em&gt; of your descriptions.

When we ask our students to explain their mathematics in writing without giving them any guidance, typical results include a string of equations and explanations that display a minimum of effort and reflection.  In order to get better writing from our students, we should be more explicit about what we want.  For instance, we could have them write for a particular audience:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write this as an explanation to an average student who will be taking this same class next semester.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write this as a newspaper article that assumes its readers have very little background knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write this in the style of an example in your course textbook.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write this in the style of a formal written proposal for grant funding for an important project.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Developing good writing skills also takes a lot of practice (revise, revise, revise!) distributed over a long period of time.  If you're really serious about improving the mathematical writing skills of students, you should start by requiring them to explain their answers to homework questions using complete sentences with correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.  Of course, this requires papers to be hand graded and for the grader to enforce this policy (e.g., by having some of the homework points be for mathematical correctness and other points dedicated to exposition).  Students who have consistently gotten feedback about their writing on the homework usually have fewer difficulties with longer writing assignments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Students need explicit guidance on what needs explaining and what does not.  Initially, many students will need to be told not to over-explain (e.g., tediously writing a sentence for each algebraic manipulation) and not to under-explain (e.g., assume their reader knows too much).  Giving students a long list of rules to follow might unintentionally produce bad results.  In general, getting students to make decisions about what to include and exclude boils down to getting them to think about what their reader needs to know in order for things to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Students need to be told repeatedly that they are expected to explain &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; they chose to do what they did.  The final result of a mathematical computation only has meaning when the problem is put into context, the assumptions are made explicit, and all of the  mathematical operations are stated clearly and justified fully. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creating and grading writing assignments is a daunting and difficult task, as is managing students during the writing process.  Good writing assignments take a ton of time to create and grade, and I would encourage you to ask you colleagues in the humanities for tricks they use to make the process go smoothly.  To ease your feedback and grading burden, I would encourage you to set aside time in class for students to exchange their work in small groups and give each other feedback on their writing.  Another trick is to use examples of good and bad writing (e.g., on a projector screen) in class to start a classroom discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of student work (make sure to get student's permission to show their work beforehand).  Using student examples in class also provides the opportunity to openly discuss what feedback you would give and how you would grade such work.  This feedback should happen before the final draft is due.  You may also want to consider having students turn in both the rough draft (with comments from other students) and the final draft at the same time, and assigning more points to the rough draft to get them to take it seriously.  Think very carefully about how to manage your students (e.g., the timeline and incentives to meet deadlines) as this can save you time and anguish when you eventually grade their work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, take advantage of technology.  For instance, would it be appropriate for your students to write their papers on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackedit.io&quot;&gt;https://stackedit.io&lt;/a&gt; (which uses MathJax and LaTeX syntax for typesetting mathematics) and share them with you via Google Drive?

Most of our students will not actually be computing integrals or testing series for convergence in their future careers (though some will), but most of them will probably have to explain something technical to their colleagues, boss or clients, and a mathematics class is a great place to learn and practice this extremely important skill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to do so, I insist that students submit their mathematical work on homework, quizzes and exams in the form of a mathematical explanations, written essay-style with properly punctuated complete English sentences, and with embedded mathematical computations or diagrams to support whatever explanation is being made.

Weaker students are sometimes mystified by my instructions, and they are sometimes stuck in the habit of writing a series of mathematical expressions separated by equal signs (whether they are equal or not) and a box around the &quot;answer&quot; at the end. So I try to unstick them from that habit. Occasionally students misunderstand my instructions as a request to justify every picky little step, and so I have to correct this, telling them that the more valuable explanations concentrate on the big idea of the solution method, emphasizing especially what might be different in this solution than in another similar one. In time, they seem to get it.

Then four cards are placed on the table. On the up side of these cards you can see, respectively, D, K, 3 and 7. Here is a rule: &quot;Every card that has a D on one side has a 3 on the other.&quot; Your task is to select all those cards, but only those cards, which you would have to turn over in order to discover whether or not the rule has been violated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;b) You have been hired to watch, via closed-circuit camera, the bouncer at a certain 18-and-over club. In order to be allowed to drink once inside the club, a patron must display valid 21-and-over ID to the bouncer, who then gives him/her a special bracelet. In theory the bouncer should check everyone's ID, but (assume for the purposes of this problem, at least!) it is not illegal for someone who is under 18 to enter the club, so you are not concerned about who the bouncer lets in or turns away, but only who gets a bracelet. You watch four people walk into the club, but because the bouncer is so large, sometimes he obscures the camera. Here is what you can see:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The first person gets a bracelet.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  The second person does not get a bracelet.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  The third person displays ID indicating they are 21.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  The fourth person does not display any ID.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You realize that you need to go down to the club to check some IDs. Precisely whose ID's do you need to check to verify that the bouncer is obeying the law?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;c) Any comments? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part a) is (up to psychological isomorphism) the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task&quot;&gt;Wason selection task&lt;/a&gt;.  Part b) is a real-world analogue designed to be closer to the students' experience.  It makes perfect sense that we do not need to recheck the IDs of anyone who did not get a bracelet: we're trying to enforce the implication &quot;If you get served drinks, you must have ID.&quot;  People can understand that no one is going to get in trouble for the people that they didn't serve drinks to.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can see relations here to one of the other (good) answers.  For one, yes, it's good to think in terms of when $A \implies B$ is false: there's just one possibility and that's what we care about, so in every other case we make it true.  But yes, I do introduce implication via the truth table.  It can also be helpful to define it as &quot;(not A) or B&quot;: that somehow seems less arbitrary, and gives them good practice seeing that the negation is &quot;A and (not B)&quot;.  But then we have the burden of explaining why we call this &quot;implies&quot;....and I've found that if you emphasize that the one possibility you need to exclude is that A is true and B is false, then it is not in fact so terribly hard for students to swallow.  I follow up with the concept of &quot;vacuously true&quot;, namely the implication is true because the hypothesis is false.  This becomes a key proof technique later in the course: sometimes you need to begin to analyze an implication $\forall x \in A$, $P(x) \implies Q(x)$ by first figuring out for which $x \in A$ it is the case that $P(x)$ is true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="176" LastActivityDate="2014-03-18T05:51:11.627" CommentCount="0" />

So, somehow one is stuck with matrices whose eigenvalues are &quot;too nice&quot; (and this even leaving the issue of factoring the polynomial aside.)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I mostly tend to give excercises where things work out nicely, yet I do talk with students about the fact that this is what happens and that this does not capture what would be a &quot;typical&quot; situation were one to choose things &quot;randomly.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is, I think it is important to raise awareness of the issue of &quot;artificially nice&quot; problems with students, but as mentioned above consider it as unavoidable to use them in certain cases.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="143" LastEditorUserId="143" LastEditDate="2014-03-18T19:24:47.153" LastActivityDate="2014-03-18T19:24:47.153" CommentCount="0" />

We use the regular limit notation, but I just say that it means infinitely close. (And I say that that's not really enough. But it's about what Newton did, and mathematicians took 150 years to do better, so it's good enough for a start.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, after the units on rules of derivatives (I call them properties) and applications, once the students see how valuable derivatives are, I introduce limits more formally. I do not ask any test questions regarding limits, but I do introduce the epsilon-delta definition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I call it the sentence that took 150 years to write, and I write it almost like a poem, one short phrase on each line:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;lim (x-&gt;c) f(x) = L &lt;br&gt;&#xA;means&lt;br&gt;&#xA;for any &amp;#949; &gt; 0 &lt;br&gt;&#xA;there is a &amp;#948; &gt; 0 &lt;br&gt;&#xA;such that&lt;br&gt;&#xA;if 0 &amp;lt; abs(x-c) &amp;lt; &amp;#948; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;then abs(f(x)-L) &amp;lt; &amp;#949;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I draw diagrams with colorful bands, much like what you see in any good textbook, and explain with lots of pointing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Then I give a colorful example to help the students understand the machinery. (I got it from a colleague many years ago. Thanks, Diane.) It uses a cookie crispness index on the y-axis, and the time your cookies are in the oven on the x-axis. Before I get into it, I ask the students what their favorite cookies are and how crisp they like them on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is doughy, 3 is still very soft and chewy, 6 is getting more crispy than chewy, and 9 is starting to get burned. Then I use one student's preference for my example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I draw a line for the function that connects cooking time to crispness, and from that I estimate the time I need to bake. Then I play with them about how perfect the cookie will be (&amp;#949;). Now I get to draw my bands.

And I haven't really ever had any problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I have done is to first introduce limits of functions be using graphs. I explain what it intuitively means that the limit of a function exists. I make very clear that the initial presentation of the concept is just to get an intuition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that we do a lot of examples using this method. We talk about limits that are pretty obvious and some where rewriting the function makes the existence of the limit clear. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After this, I then state the precise definition. I should the several examples of how to prove that the limit of a function is a given number. I make sure to keep the format of the proofs the same. So I always start by writing &quot;proof&quot; and the &quot;Let $\epsilon &amp;gt; 0 $ be given&quot; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After showing several examples of even quadratics, I go back and end with some linear functions. For the exams I just require them to know how to prove the limits of linear functions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And all this in general works out pretty well. I will admit that the first example or two are very confusing for the students, but after realizing that we keep doing the same thing over and over, they come to appreciate the rigor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you could(should?) include examples where you have a specific value of $\epsilon$ given. The students then have to find a/the corresponding value of $\delta$ that will work. In my experience I have done this right after the definition or after you have done all the examples.

I didn’t really understand what a “proof” was. By going to seminars, reading papers, and talking to other graduate students, I gradually began to catch on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Within any field, there are certain theorems and certain techniques that are generally known and generally accepted. When you write a paper, you refer to these without proof. You look at other papers in the field, and you see what facts they quote without proof, and what they cite in their bibliography. You learn from other people some idea of the proofs. Then you’re free to quote the same theorem and cite the same citations. You don’t necessarily have to read the full papers or books that are in your bibliography. Many of the things that aregenerally known are things for which there may be no known written source. As long as people in the field are comfortable that theidea works, it doesn’t need to have a formal written source. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;At first I was highly suspicious of this process. I would doubt whether a certain idea was really established. But I found that I could ask people, and they could produce explanations and proofs, or else refer me to other people or to written sources that would give explanations and proofs. There werepublished theorems that were generally known to be false, or where the proofs were generally known to be incomplete. Mathematical knowledge and understanding were embedded in the minds and in the social fabric of the community of people thinking about a particular topic. This knowledge was supported by written documents, but the written documents were not really primary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I think this pattern varies quite a bit from field to field. I wasinterested in geometric areas of mathematics, where it is often pretty hard to have a document that reflects well the way people actually think. In more algebraic or symbolic fields, this is not necessarily so, and I have the impression that in some areas documents are much closer to carrying the life of the field. But in any field, there is a strong social standard of validity and truth. Andrew Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem is a good illustration of this, in a field which isvery algebraic. The experts quickly came to believe that his proof was basicallycorrect on the basis of high-level ideas, long before details could be checked. This proof will receive a great deal of scrutiny and checking compared to most mathematical proofs; but no matter how the process of verification plays out, it helps illustrate how mathematics evolves by rather organic psychological and social processes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So essentially, his view is that what a proof is is essentially based off of societal norms backed up by paper documents when neccessary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, I feel this translates to 'a proof is an argument which convinces the grader that you have either written all the details or are able to provide them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Formatting of the quote may be off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="78" LastEditorUserId="78" LastEditDate="2014-03-19T02:26:16.787" LastActivityDate="2014-03-19T02:26:16.787" CommentCount="0" />

I would characterize the main goal of the course just to get the students up to speed computationally. For many students, they only really learn algebra in calculus. I say learn in the sense that they apply algebra to solve problems which cannot be fit into some standard form. In calculus, the algebra is wild, untamed, it goes where it wishes and you better be able to deal with it. This struggle ideally produces students with greater algebraic maturity and, naturally, a working understanding of the conceptual accomplishments of calculus. Proofs were rarely given and even when they were I would often give a &quot;physicsy proof&quot;. For example $\sin(h) /h \approx 1$ is obvious if you just look at a tiny triangle incribed in the unit circle. I suppose my perspective when first teaching was in part the natural outgrowth of my origins story; I was raised by physicsists.

Partly, I just want to demystify the idea of a proof for them. I want them to see that a proof is not some rigid construct as we sometimes encounter in highschool geometry. I also want them to see that we can give a nearly complete account for why things are true. Of course, I do not test too heavily on the proof aspect of the course. For example, in treating $\epsilon-\delta$ I only require the linear and quadratic cases for the test. I prove several limit laws from the precise definition. Now, for the majority of students, this is probably annoying. But, honestly, they have the same feeling about limit laws. Every approach has it's advantages and disadvantages and I think what is best depends on your particular audience. That said, I found this approach has attracted students from other majors.

It went fabulously and I stuck to the lesson plan covering every point on my slide show and getting through every activity only having to shorten the pair and share activity due to time constraints. The students understood everything, responded to discussion well, and the observing teacher gave me a glorious review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I had to present the same lesson to my Education class. Within the first five minutes, I realized that there was only a single person in the entire class with the background needed to understand the mathematics I was presenting. This made the warm-up exercise and discussion extremely one-sided. In that moment, I decided to abandon my lesson plan and launched into a discussion about crappy furniture. Every college student can understand crappy furniture even if none of them understood what variance had to do with it. By the end of the lesson, most of the students had a reasonably good grasp on the concept of standard deviation and how it relates to Ikea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any time you're speaking to an audience, you have to pay attention to their attitude and capture their attention.&lt;/strong&gt; In my example it's a bit different than most teaching situations because I had prepared for a class that had the background to understand my content but the idea can carry over to any classroom.

Anyone can appreciate the fact a diagonal matrix is much easier to study than a non-diagonal matrix. Diagonalization then offers a power tool to study any property which is invariant through similarity by reducing a matrix which we know little about to a matrix which is zero everywhere except the diagonal.

You can then start talking about how to calculate powers of matrices.  You can draw pictures of Markov chains, which is more pleasant than just writing down matrices.  You can make a compelling argument for the usefulness of very large matrices, which can seem gratuitous in other contexts.  You can draw Markov chains that have repeated eigenvalues for obvious reasons of symmetry, which is instructive.

Again, the necessity of both real and complex eigenvalues is revealed by a topic which is a natural curiousity (rotations in $n$-dimensions ). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this said, the application of Jordan chains to unravel the matrix exponential and assemble the general solution to $x'=Ax$ is to my taste a powerful showcase. However, the intended audience needs some desire and/or familiarity with ODEs to appreciate it. While we're at it; I have found the connection between generalized eigenvectors and the double-root solution to be a satisfying justification for studying them in years past. I mean, I want to be able to solve all the ODEs with constant coefficients, not just the problems which happen to be diagonalizable. I wish more of us thought generalized e-vectors were worth teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a physicsy audience it's easier. Eigenvectors are the observable states. Eigenvalues are the values of energy, momentum, spin etc... of the system which the states represent. That's fundamental physics. The question of simultaneous diagonalization becomes interesting as it is the question of being able to simultaneous know the values of a pair of observables for a given pair of physical quantities. For a non-example, momentum and position $[x,p] \neq 0$ hence we cannot find simultaneous eigenstates of $x$ and $p$.

But mostly, I think that the argument of &lt;em&gt;Students like bonus problems...I think they [with the reward of extra credit] encourage doing more than was necessary while studying&lt;/em&gt; (which I believe to be roughly the standard argument, but this is (essentially) a quote from Tim Seguine in the comments) just isn't good enough. In the real world money is not the only motivation, and I would not like it if, for example, the police force was driven by money rather than a desire to make where I live a safe place. Similarly, if we replace &quot;money&quot; with &quot;final grade&quot; then I do not think it is healthy to motivate students solely by their final grade. I believe an alternative motivation can and should be used in place of &quot;extra credit&quot;. For example: Chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More concretely, I tell my students that if they can find an error in my notes or in my problem sheets then they should come to my office and I will reward them with chocolate (in their answer, vonbrand says that they reward this with extra credit). This means that they can argue all they like about whether or not they deserve chocolate (they point out the errors, but they do it in lectures!), but ultimately the arguments are in good humour as they are arguing over...a piece of chocolate. Additional &quot;extra credit&quot; questions which are meant to motivate the students now become competitions where the winners get, say, a not-quite-the-cheapest box of chocolates. Now, because the rewards are chocolate everything is fun while the students remain motivated (well, enough of them remain motivated to keep me happy), so this all adds to the student experience. I believe that if I replaced &quot;chocolate&quot; with &quot;extra credit&quot; then there would be no improvement in the student's grasping of the subject and I would enjoy lecturing &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastEditorUserId="169" LastEditDate="2014-03-20T10:06:48.233" LastActivityDate="2014-03-20T10:06:48.233" CommentCount="0" />

I mention this because my question is about technology and distractions. I feel that many students are distracted by technology: they would sit in class texting and checking facebook if allowed. The issue that I (and presumably many others) face then is that students cannot reach their potential because they are distracting themselves. This frustrates me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What can a lecturer do to stop students being distracted by technology in their lectures?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two obvious approaches: ban technology, or pretend it is not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ban technology:&lt;/strong&gt; Pretend that we live in y2k. The main advantage is that the students cannot be distracted. Some disadvantages are that if students want to look at my slides at their own pace then they have to print them out (I have no scrolling boards so my lectures are frustratingly slide-heavy), which is far from ideal, and that some students who will not be engaged anyway will become disruptive (this can happen with or without taking attendance). Finally, &quot;banning&quot; technology doesn't do much to foster a happy or encouraging learning environment, as the students claim that they are grown ups and can decide for themselves while the ban needs to be enforced which generates fear (for some value of &quot;fear&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore technology:&lt;/strong&gt; Pretend that noone is checking facebook. The advantage is that students can view the slides and take notes on their tablets. Technology is good and they are embracing it! Of course, many students will become distracted and I find this frustrating. Moreover, often students will become distracted by other people using technology, which is something I certainly don't want to happen (for example, during my undergrad I remember a very forward-thinking student bringing his laptop to a lecture. He sat in the front row playing Quake. The lecturer didn't notice, but everyone else was transfixed by this guys wonderful Quake-playing abilities. He was rather good...).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently, I have a sort of middle ground where I allow technology but ask frequent questions and get students to work on exercises at regular intervals. This helps distract them from their technology and lets me patrol for facebook users.

But I would encourage the lecturer and the TAs to do so and tell the students different notations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More detailed answer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many students, the topic itsself is hard enough. I don't think you should distract them from the most important things for notation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you can tell them, that there are different ways to write down things and the most important point is the notation should be consistent. For example, I've seen it several times that at the point of the definition, there were several methods mentioned to write down the new object (here: the derivative) and then in the lecture &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; of these notations was used, but on the exercices another notation was used (this is - as I later learned - due to the fact that someone else was makeing exercises, but he hasn't talked about notation with the professor). Students will learn that different people use different notation and every notation has some advantages and disadvantages. Of course, it could be that students are confused at the first point (&quot;What does that strange symbol in the exercises mean?&quot; - You can explain it and you can write more than a symbol in the first exercise where it appears. Later on it should be clear). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should encourage the students to make up their minds what a good notation is to their understanding.&lt;/strong&gt; And the students should use that notation consequently as long as they are satisfied. (This changes from time to time. I for example was a big fan of the $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f$ until I took a class about partial differential equations where I discovered that my old notation was a nightmare. Than I changed my whole notation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think, it is important that students should be flexible and open-minded to notation: It can be that in every lecture there is a different notation, in books and later in papers, people use different notation (in bad ones, the notation chances from chapter to chapter). But one should never overemphasize the discussion of notation since there are more important things to teach. &lt;strong&gt;And you should not jump arround with notation&lt;/strong&gt; (otherwise the notation gets the focus and students will ask you about the meaning of the symbols rather than about the content).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of my arguments given is not specific to the notation of derivatives, but also in a general context. Maybe the most easy examples where some students have problems with notation is the example where an equation should not be solves for $x$, but for a different variable. Another example would be the use of another symbol than $f$ for a function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="114" LastActivityDate="2014-03-20T19:18:29.320" CommentCount="0" />

Trying to institute something in the middle of the semester can only start arguments (&quot;It's not in the syllabus I can't do this!&quot; or &quot;But we've been doing this all semester to take notes!&quot;), but if necessary, give them some forewarning to the new policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find that, particularly in math courses, it is difficult to take notes on a laptop unless the instructor provides the slides (and if those should be used in a class is another question entirely). Additionally, many classes are now going online for their homework, so students will use class time to work on homework. There are a few questions here. Is my course easy to take lecture notes on a computer with? Do I want students working on homework in class? What do I do if students are using technology inappropriately?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This answers depends on the the structure of the course. In all cases, I will make an announcement on the first day of class stating my policy (no laptops, limited laptops, etc) and what I will do if someone breaks the policy (ask to put it away, stop class, ask to leave, etc). You need to set clear boundaries on distractions to the students and have them know the consequences. They know that classes are for learning and that you are there to foster that. A reasonable student, when asked to stop playing Quake for example, will stop. If you have TA's, I would ask if they would sit in the back and inform you if someone is being distracting. Else I would occasionally move around the room during lecture and to pay attention to where students eyes are looking. It should be fairly obvious when someone isn't working.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, the level of technology is course dependent. As I am not too familiar with power point style lectures, I would leave that up to your discretion and decide if you post the lectures online before or not to have laptops. Personally in math, I find that the use of hand written lectures (either on a projector or chalk board) is the most used. In these, I find that it is near impossible for students to type up notes at a comparable rate to your lectures. In this case, I would put in the syllabus that laptops and other devises are not allowed in lecture and that I expect students to copy notes into a notebook. If students pulls out a laptop, I would just politely ask them to put it away and remind them of the policy. Now some days you can make exceptions (review days, etc), but always let them know at least a lecture in advance. With this, I believe that homework should be done outside of class and is no excuse for a laptop. If I do a problem in class, students should just copy it to the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technology in class can be beneficial, but I find it is more engaging than the instructor most of the time (particularly if they are reading off slides). To fight off student boredom, keep them engaged and interacting with you. Ask them questions, poll them for answers, and get them to work together will help push off their want of technology. I've seen an increased use of flipped classrooms and clickers to poll students and keep them engaged. You can't win against phones (just ask for them to put them away if seen), but if they are enjoying class, they are less likely to check them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you say you are more or less stuck to using slides, why not see about getting a tablet and use computer written notes? Your IT department might have some for loan for use in lectures.

And, I think it is quite useful to spend some time on discussing these different ways and to mention the different notations in that context. (However I understand this is not always possible, see the end.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the notation $f'$ and $\dot{y}$ stresses the (physical) idea of having some function that describes something (some process) and one does something to it to analyze/understand its properties.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the notation $D_x f$ emphasizes the fact that one can think of the situation of having an operator (a function!) $D_x$ that assigns to each (under suitable conditions) function $f$ another function $D_xf$. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the notation $\frac{df}{dx}$ emphasizes the definition as a limit of the quotients of differences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the notation $df(x)$, in particular when used like $f(x+h) = f(x) + df(x)h + r(h)$ stresses that the derivative at a some point is actually a linear function that just happens to be identifiable with its slope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There would  also be different ways to split things up and to motivate things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If one does this the different notations come more naturally and one then can and I think should vary one's own usage and exercises a bit. Still, I would &lt;em&gt;not insist&lt;/em&gt; or even much encourage students &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; different notations themselves. There is some clear merit in having them &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the different notations; for them being able to use different ones (fuently) this is much less clear to me. There is also a small risk that they would use them, but would use them not really 'idiomatically,' as the notations arein some sense not completely interchangable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example even an example in OP seems slightly of to me (though some place else different conventions might be in place): as far as I know, the dot-notation is mainly used by physicist and alike, and does typically not denote just some derivative, but writing $\dot{y}$ &quot;means&quot; derivative by &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, which &quot;would never&quot; be denoted $x$ but $t$. [For me, as a pure mathematician, the above is strange to write, but I really think that if $y=xt^2$, then to some it is completely obvious that $\dot{y}=2xt$ and not $\dot{y}=t^2$.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This answer assumes of course that one has time to do this discussion, and implicitly also that the students or a considerable part there of will actually see the higher dimensional theory for example. If this is not the case, I think I would not bother much with different notations. Pick one (based on your own preference or possibly informed by the predominant convention in whatever other field the students might study, if there is one) and stick to it, and just mention once that there are different notations, so that students are not completely surprised when the open some other book.

Lectures were MWF and recitations TuTh. I assigned weekly homework assignments collected and returned in recitation. This was our &quot;intro to proofs&quot; course, a 100-level course entitled &quot;Concepts of Math&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method:&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote and distributed detailed grading rubrics for homework problems. I also assigned specific &lt;em&gt;problems&lt;/em&gt; to each TA, rather than have them grade everything from their own section. (Logistically, this was accomplished via a locked filing cabinet in a designated room that everyone had access to. Homework was turned in on Th, TAs would visit over the next few days to grade, and papers were returned on Tu.) My goal was to standardize grades across the sections throughout the semester, rather than at the end via statistical normalizing. My advisor had always used the end-of-term statistical method, but I worried this might foster jealousy of other sections with easy graders / contempt for TAs with high standards. I also helped out by grading one problem per assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used the same procedure for exams. I wrote detailed rubrics, including provisions for multiple methods of solution, predictions of common mistakes and how to handle them, and tips for providing good feedback beyond just a score. I graded a couple of questions on each exam, and read through a bunch of them to get a sense for how the students were doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For homework grading questions/complaints, I told the students to talk to their TA first, who would then direct them to the TA (or me) who graded the question. If that could not be resolved, they could come to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For exams, I gave the students exactly one week after return in which they could write up a document to explain their issue, their understanding of the relevant problem, and how their demonstration of knowledge should deserve more points. I would then read each of these and, when appropriate, raise the grade; either way, I wrote a response back to help them understand the grading as it was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; I honestly think this was a great success, and am very proud of how the logistics of this course were handled, looking back. I never had complaints from students about unfairness, and I spoke with some of them often enough on a personal level that I like to think I could have determined whether there was an undercurrent amongst them that was just unspoken. When I did receive grading complaints, they were often of the form &quot;I don't understand why I lost points here, can you explain more?&quot; and I would do so on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes, their complaints were valid (and, indeed, there was one grader who was sloppy and unfair on early assignments, so I had to have a long meeting with them and show them how to better; thereafter, they improved greatly). Sometimes, they were just grade-grubbing, but in those cases, I was glad I had those formal rubrics written out, so I could point to the problem and say, &quot;This part was worth X points, and you didn't address issue Y. There's nothing I can do, in fairness to other students.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; As much of a success as this was, it required a &lt;em&gt;huge time commitment&lt;/em&gt; from me as the primary instructor. I spent a lot of time designing the rubrics, taking into account my experiences grading similar problems in the past as a TA myself. I spent a lot of time answering TA questions, in person and via email, about grading issues. I spent a lot of time talking to students about homework problems (and how they were graded). I spent a lot of time just outright grading. But that was my choice. Ultimately, I enjoyed it all and don't regret it, simply for the experience that I gained from it all. I was glad to have TAs who cared as much about grading fairness as I did and didn't see it as just a teaching job on the side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this is grossly infeasible. This was the &lt;em&gt;one course&lt;/em&gt; I was teaching at the time while finishing my dissertation and, even then, it was cutting into my life. Like I said, I enjoyed all of it, but it just doesn't scale upwards nicely at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, I now have a cache of homework/exam problems as well as their solutions and grading rubrics, and could happily share these with future instructors. So, perhaps this doesn't have to be a perpetual problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt; Frankly, I would strive for this but make sacrifices where they are needed to save time/effort. In the future, if I have more than one course like this, I would first cut the actual grading of problems myself. Or, at the least, I would make sure one problem is completely trivial to grade, almost like a multiple-choice problem. By reading through those submissions, I could at least get some sense of how the students are doing. I would then cut time in the development of the rubrics. As it was, I spent much time considering varied approaches to problems and trying to nip grading considerations in the bud a priori. This isn't necessary, if you're willing to put trust in your TAs and potentially spend the time answering their email questions as they come up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I feel strongly that the statistical method is flawed, and personally prefer a method that attempts to standardize grading across sections. Specifically, I actively promote the &lt;em&gt;each person grades a problem, not a section&lt;/em&gt; method. I believe this is the only way to be truly fair, and I don't think it requires &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much more effort on the part of the instructor/TAs to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastActivityDate="2014-03-21T01:36:17.060" CommentCount="2" />

Therefore, it is quite clear that $\frac{d}{dx}(a+x^2)=2x$ whereas $\frac{d}{da}(a+x^2) = 1$. In both of these calculations I assume that the complementary variable is held fixed in the differentiation. What do these look like in the prime notation? Well,&#xA;$$ (a+x^2)' = 2x $$&#xA;is what my students would probably write. Perhaps, on occassion $(a+x^2)'=1$ would be offered by the sarcastic outlier. To actually be clear, we have to include the parenthetical evaluation:&#xA;$$ (a+x^2)'(x) = 2x \qquad \&amp;amp; \qquad (a+x^2)'(a) = 1. $$&#xA;Even so, some might be tempted to write $(a+x^2)'(a) = 2a$.

There's no way they'll pull any funny business while you're actively looking at them and no one else. And they now know you're aware of them, so they might be less likely to try something later when you're across the room but have them on your mind. However, this can call attention to you and the student you're watching, depending on how loud you make your ahemming and how intent you make your staring. Although, if the eye-wandering is particularly glaring, you might &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to make your staring obvious and deterrent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak to the room at large, reminding them that they should keep their eyes on their own paper and cheating will be punished&lt;/strong&gt;. The great thing about this is that you can do it whether you see one pair or twelve pairs of wandering eyes. You can say it not only while scanning your eyes across the room but also while the students &lt;em&gt;see you scanning&lt;/em&gt; your eyes across the room, so they don't feel individually called out for crimes (falsely or otherwise) and they also feel like you're being vigilant. The bad thing about this is that it can disrupt focused students. If I were intently working on a problem and were all of a sudden snapped out of my concentration to be reminded not to cheat (which I wasn't doing anyway), I might be miffed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call out a potential offender and either move them to a new seat or take away their test&lt;/strong&gt;.

Of course, if I'm wrong, this can totally backfire.

The problem is, however, even if you spent even more time, the problems arise when you see the homework.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Students did some mistakes destroying the structure of the questions (when you said &quot;When someone arrives at that certain point, he/she will get 2 points, etc. - And they did some alternative way with a nice idea you did not think about, but not comparable to other solutions). Or they did something else you didn't plan for. In these cases, TAs have to make up their minds and everyone will problably grad in different ways. Or students did some subtle error which can be overlooked by inexperienced TAs. Lets face reality: Some TAs correct also every deep (They take responsiblity of their work) and some correct sketchy (due to time or competence). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to maximize this, there are several possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can divide the homework into questions and every TAs has to correct only one questions. If he/she e.g. overlooks some subtle error, then he/she it for everyone. The problem here is that students have to visit several different TAs if they have questions about the grading. If your TAs have in general a free weekend, you can also do the extreme way that one TAs is grading all the homework (this is possible in courses with at most 100-150, but not with the mentioned 700). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can ask the TAs to write emails to everyone reflecting each equivalent class of solution. If there is some good responsible TAs, he/she will get most of the errors and suggest the grading for such a solution and the rest can follow. The big problem is that you have to describe and summarize solution and read maybe 50-100 emails every week. I have seen this sometimes when only a few TAs have to grad exams for a lot of students. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can have extra grading sessions where all TAs meet and discuss directly if something appears. This is very effective, but you have to find a date where all TAs are free. Also, the problem is that maybe someone is faster than the others etc. If the groups are really small or the homework is not much, this is maybe the best solution.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I think you can never attain the maximum by this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last time we had a bigger course (about 100-150 students, which is big in our department), there were not too few complains about grading although there was weekly very long meeting with all TAs and they were forced to come to me if anything is not clear, etc. We also saw this in statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the date of the exercise groups was the same for all TAs and we &lt;strong&gt;decided to rotate the TAs between the different groups.&lt;/strong&gt; The message was: &quot;Yes, the world is not fair and in case of doubt, some persons will give a better grade and other persons will give a worse grade. In order to have to same condition for every student, we switch TAs every X weeks.&quot; (In smaller courses you can try that every student and every TAs have met; in bigger courses you maybe have to find a out a good mixture of severe and slack TAs with the contraint of their timetable.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a nutshell, I think the method worked really well.&lt;/strong&gt; Some problems occured:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For psychological reasons, you should communicate this at the beginning of the course. For some students, their feelings boiled over due to the &quot;surprise&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The main focus of the groups should be to learn something, to ask questions, etc. -- If there is a regular change for the TAs, many students will not dare to ask questions. There should not be too many changes. I tried a intervall with 5 meetings (From a different viewpoint: If the students get some TAs they don't like, they can then count to 5 and get a new one).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After the first change, there were many complaints: Most of them were either from good students having problems with a inexperienced TAs or poor students now getting worse grades. The TAs should be strongly encouraged to take over their responsibility (and you may combine the &quot;change-method&quot; with some of the methods above) in order to avoid such situations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some students wanted to change the group in order to &quot;travel&quot; with the TAs.

Men stronger focus on technical applications (physics, engineering, economics, computer science).

It is two years old now and we are extensively under development in both scientific and administrative aspects. We are somehow famous now and some other universities are following a same pattern.  Let me to explain more about some parameters which I guess could be useful for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. I have a dream.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First note that you are building a new society in an old society so you should have something new to say. Thus you need an exact plan including all of your goals in short and long time and all possible ways which can help your group to reach them. Determining all of the scientific and non-scientific purposes, designing the structure of your organization and also defining possible opportunities which the group can provide for its members are the main duties of your &quot;president&quot; at the first step. These parameters are so important and you should pay enough attention to design them. Write them all exactly in a &quot;constitution&quot; and ask people to read it before joining your group. This document will be your first tool for defining a new abstract identity like a math group &quot;independent&quot; from its members. The best example is a football club. In fact any football club is just a production of its members including players, coaches, managers, fans, etc. but it has an &quot;independent&quot; identity from its members too. At first a football club is just a name and it is the founders who are its real identity but after a while when all of its founders are retired, the club itself is still operational and can give a new identity to its members and managers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. A beautiful name, a beautiful mind!&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to emphasize on the identity of your math group choose an adequate name, design a pretty logo and find an impressive motto. These simple parameters are very important because they are the first &quot;representatives&quot; of your group everywhere. You should choose them carefully and use these everywhere in your website, documents, colloquiums, mails, posters, etc. Use the advisement of professionals to choose the best. Being too informal in these cases is not recommended because maybe you will participate in official communications with the other mathematical groups in/out of your university and it is better to be formal in these communications. In comparison with managing a country your constitution is your &quot;law&quot;, your logo is your &quot;national flag&quot; and your motto is your &quot;national anthem&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Build internal and external networks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By an external network I mean communicating with the other similar scientific/math groups. This helps your group to remain up to date. It also helps the others to be familiar with your activities and this encourages your members to be more active.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By an internal network I mean something like a forum/website just for your members and a very regular announcement system with a particular organizer (a public communication manager) which announces the last news of the group to all members. This helps the members to remain connected with the group even if they are graduated and far from the university for years.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Regular Events.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The scientific activities of the group should be very regular. Define different levels of activities in each year and separate the audiences for each part. There are two main levels of activities. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minor Events:&lt;/em&gt; As like as weekly seminars/colloquiums and study/research programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organize such events per week/month/semester. In this case the audiences are &quot;local&quot; including your members, department faculties, university students, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Major Events:&lt;/em&gt; As like as organizing national/international conferences.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Organize such events per year/two years.In this case, the audiences are &quot;global&quot; including people from other universities all around of the country/world. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;regularity&quot; is too important. People should count on your activities as a habit. Also these regular colloquiums will help your members to take the identity of the group more serious. This point of view remains alive even if a part of your members be graduated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Teachers as Members.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Invite your teachers/supervisors to be a member of your group. They can help you scientifically and supervise activities with a better view. Also you can offer a president position to one of them (in your case maybe one of the female faculty members of your department) which helps the group to keep its organization safe from graduating its student members because the faculty members are in the university for a longer time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Remain Neutral to be Popular!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding to your comment on a math group &lt;em&gt;for women&lt;/em&gt;, I think your idea for &lt;em&gt;helping women to become researchers in mathematics&lt;/em&gt; is very interesting and surely reasonable but I am not sure that organizing a math group just for women is useful in this direction. I think there are better ways for reaching this goal. In principal I believe that if we define a x-group (here x=math) this community should be &lt;em&gt;neutral&lt;/em&gt; in any other aspect y different from x in order to be as popular as possible amongst people. I mean a math group should not be politically right or left, religiously up or down, racially white or black, sexually masculine or feminine, etc. Every body who likes math can be a member of a math group and limiting the membership to women seems inappropriate. Of course having a neutral math group in any non-mathematical aspect doesn't mean that each one of your members should be neutral in each non-mathematical aspect. It just says that you should be careful about the population balance of the group because people don't like to be one of the minorities in each community. Thus for example if you have a member with a right political point of view you should search for another member with a left political point of view to keep the political balance of the group safe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.

So if you are not scary what kind of a monster are you?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; Based on this philosophy she wants to &quot;&lt;em&gt;make great students greater, not make mediocre students less mediocre.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; and this &lt;em&gt;mediocre&lt;/em&gt; students have no place in her Scaring Program.

Thus dean Hardscrabble simply removes Mike from her scaring program.       &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now back to mathematics. Unfortunately one can find some math professors in some math departments all around the world who believe that having an inborn special ability is absolutely necessary for becoming a good mathematician and one's voluntary efforts cannot help him/her too much in this direction and efforts just can make a &quot;potentially&quot; good math student better and cannot help students who haven't this mathematical &quot;potential&quot; at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to discuss on truth or falsity of this point of view.

To me such an error is mostly a notational issue, where the students who instinctually know what they're doing and do get to the right answer, just write it poorly.

If I noticed students doing this, I would provide the example $F(x) =\int_0^x x^2dx$ and evaluate $F(1)$ to show how they're over use of the variable x confuses things. Interpreting as a valuation of the area under a curve, this $F$ is a function on the width of the area under the curve, not the curve itself. Thus they should have differing variables, perhaps written as $F(x) = \int_0^x t^2 dt$, and compare this to the fundamental theorem of calculus's statement on this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think mathematics needs a &quot;local variable&quot; concept, the instructor just needs to make it more clear what each variable is of (i.e., x is of width of area (or limit of integration) and t is the integrand). Many students at this level are not use to several variables being used, so renaming them is not a first instinct (book might use x as integrand for example).

Slides kill spontaneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slides are one-way.  They are entirely about the professor conveying information to the students.  But this isn't how a classroom should work at all -- there should be a give and take between the students and the professor, with the professor responding to students' questions, and deciding what to do next based on how well the audience seems to understand things so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slides are inflexible.  What do you do during class if a student asks a question and you decide to talk about something unexpected for 20 minutes?  What if your lesson plan isn't working and you decide that you need to talk about some prerequisite topic for most of class?  Using slides forces you to stay on a certain track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, there is a huge advantage to having good pictures or animations for certain topics, and in some classes I routinely have my laptop attached to the projector for this purpose.

One can simply cover the planned material more quickly and supplement with more sophisticated asides or extensions of that material. This is relatively easy to do, and often quite enjoyable, since it is always a pleasure to teach students who are able and eager to learn more. One simply provides them with more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A much more difficult case, in contrast, occurs when one realizes that the students are weaker than had been expected and perhaps not able to master the material that had been intended for the course. In this case, the instructor may find him or herself at a loss. The matter may come to a head if the course is part of a long chain of courses, where the students must really know the stuff before the next course. In that case, one thing to do is go into emergency mode, concentrating the course on the most essential easiest parts, and try to give the students what they need to advance. But my considered opinion is that it is actually rarely the case that students must really master a set syllabus, even when the course is part of a long chain of courses. So instead, one can adjust the course to the students, providing them with suitable material that enriches their mathematical lives, even if this isn't what was originally planned. One must re-focus the course to be suitable for the students taking it. (This situation would probably be accompanied at the end by lower grades than usual for the course, in light of the reduced level of the material.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal style of teaching tends to have a lot of flexibility, where I follow new topics that come up in class, or respond to students ideas by exploring a related topic more fully. So I find it easy to make this kind of change in stride, both for advancing the course and for slowing it down, depending on what is called for. But I know that other instructors like to have a more rigid plan, with topics and assignments planned long in advance, and I can see that this would make it more difficult to accommodate changes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from those kinds of issues, another kind of a difficulty can arise when one realizes part way into the course that the chosen textbook is not suitable for some reason. Perhaps one realizes after the course has begun that the textbook is too difficult or focuses too much on the wrong topics, in a way that cannot be easily overcome. Fortunately, this has happened to me only once in my teaching career (about twenty years), but what a problem when it does happen! What I did was to essentially abandon the unsuitable textbook, and begin essentially to use another text. I provided print-outs to the students of the new material, as well as more thorough notes than usual. In the end, the course became refocused on the ideas I had wanted, in a way that was appropriate for the students. But of course, it would have been better if I had realized the unsuitability of the text much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="90" LastActivityDate="2014-03-23T00:14:49.023" CommentCount="0" />

Read more here!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A very successful way for introducing online math forums to people including students and teachers (which I usually use) is inciting their &lt;em&gt;sense of curiosity&lt;/em&gt; to know what is going on in these forums. To do this one can use several methods. The simplest way is explaining an interesting and &quot;unusual&quot; idea which can be found in MO/MSE &quot;uniquely&quot;. The uniqueness is important. They should be convinced that &lt;em&gt;there are something special in online math forums which cannot be found in the usual texts and courses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Search for ideas not for solutions!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Form the point of view of your students to consider online math forums as a &lt;em&gt;source of interesting ideas&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;an easy tool for solving their problems&lt;/em&gt;. The first one leads them to become great adventurer researchers interested in new point of views and unknown realms of knowledge and the second one leads them to become lazy students who are searching for shortcuts continuously.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Need your teacher's help? Find him/her online when you want!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a math department when some of its faculty members are continuously present in a particular online forum like MO it is a good idea to let students know that they can have a direct access to their teachers/advisers by participating in these forums. Surely it could be very interesting for both graduate and undergraduate students because each teacher has a limited meeting time per week. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Teaching MathOverflow as a part of Teaching Math.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It could be a good idea if those teachers who are active users of online math forums explain good asking/answering techniques in one of their lectures during their courses. One lecture per each course is completely enough and natural because one can say:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Dear students, in the last lecture I told you there are some useful online math forums which can help you in many aspects but like any other thing you should know how to use it! Let me to explain more... &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Don't be so shy! No one is perfect!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Online math forums like real societies are full of the different persons with different personalities. One should be aware of this point that any situation is possible in these communities and so he/she should know how to react these actions. Frankly speaking unfortunately in some aspects the culture of MO (and MSE) is too unfriendly. There are users who &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to call the others &lt;em&gt;silly&lt;/em&gt; (to prove that they are so clever!). Some others are too &lt;em&gt;dominative&lt;/em&gt;. Somebodies are &lt;em&gt;narcist&lt;/em&gt;. Some others are good but had a bad day! There are people who don't know when they should use an implicit sentence (instead of an explicit one) to refer a specific problem on somebody's act/post/comment and so on. These aggressive behaviors could be done against anybody even against the top users. (Unfortunately recently in one of the MO set theory posts I found a bad comment by one of the good users of MO against one of your helpful comments. I don't want to mention the case explicitly but this shows that an aggressive act could be happened even for the best users of online professional forums). What one of your new students should do in such a situation? Surely you can help them about it with your advisement. What I can say to them is:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Don't struggle with people at all. If you are not agree with their opinion simply ignore their critic remarks and do what you want. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Note to friendly admonitions and use them but don't take the critics &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; serious. No one is perfect even the bests.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Some people are xenophobic against new users of the community and conservative about new ideas and methods. If you think you have something new to say don't be so shy to explain and defend it peacefully.   &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Cheating Here! Cheating There! Cheating Everywhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are encouraging your students to participate in MO/MSE (which is very good) please don't make it too formal for them. Math forums should be interesting for students by their usefulness as a place which young students can find precious ideas, talk with the bests of the field and feel free to share their own ideas with professionals. These are enough to encourage them for contributing continuously in the community and considering the &lt;em&gt;quality of their participation&lt;/em&gt; as a part of their grades or a type of homeworks causes an expected phenomenon, cheating! Using an inaccurate formal numerical criterion like MO/MSE &lt;em&gt;reputation&lt;/em&gt; makes this approach more harmful. Your face to face comments about your students contribution on MO/MSE could be much more helpful. For example:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Alice! I like your last post in MSE very much, if you are interested in exploring the idea you can find these references useful. Please let me know about the result of your research.

Whenever there is more than one triangle, the dual graph (like any tree) must have a vertex with only one neighbor, corresponding to a triangle that is adjacent to other triangles along only one of its sides. The simpler polygon formed by removing this triangle has a 3-coloring by mathematical induction, and this coloring is easily extended to the one additional vertex of the removed triangle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Once a 3-coloring is found, the vertices with any one color form a valid guard set, because every triangle of the polygon is guarded by its vertex with that color.

For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max-flow_min-cut_theorem&quot;&gt;Max Flow Min Cut Theorem&lt;/a&gt; was first proven in 1956, and the definition and basic properties of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth&quot;&gt;treewidth&lt;/a&gt; were not introduced until 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamical Systems picked up steam slowly, and many of the fundamental results were proven in the second half of the 20th century.  For example, the theorem that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PeriodThreeTheorem.html&quot;&gt;period three implies chaos&lt;/a&gt; for a one-dimensional system was proven in 1975, though it was a special case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharkovskii%27s_theorem&quot;&gt;Sharkovskii's Theorem&lt;/a&gt;, which was proven in 1964 but not well known until later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, most of the fundamental results of Complex Dynamics and Fractal Geometry are quite new.  The first pictures of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set&quot;&gt;Mandelbrot set&lt;/a&gt; did not appear until 1978, and many important results are newer still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game Theory is a relatively new subject.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium&quot;&gt;Nash equilibria&lt;/a&gt; were first defined in general by Nash in 1951, so most of the known results are newer than this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knot Theory has been developing quickly in the last half of the 20th century.  For example, the tabulation of knots with up to 11 crossing was not completed until 1974, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_polynomial&quot;&gt;Jones polynomial&lt;/a&gt; was not defined until 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastActivityDate="2014-03-23T16:06:26.403" CommentCount="0" />

Students of all ages should be taught about logic grid puzzles, tangrams, mazes, magic squares, sodoku, minesweeper, Rubik's cubes, towers of Hanoi and so forth in math class, as well as games such as nim, dots and boxes, sprouts, etc.  Puzzle-solving is a basic mode of creative thought, and it needs to be explicitly included in the curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to such explicit logic puzzles, teachers at the elementary school level should endeavor to include small mathematical puzzles that the students can potentially solve.  Especially if they work in groups of two or three, fourth or fifth grade students ought to be able to solve a simple puzzle like&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Find two numbers whose sum is 22 and whose product is 96.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We teach explicit methods for these things when they get to algebra class, but in elementary school students ought to be clever enough to figure out a puzzle like this without having any explicit method.

It also seems that East Asian teachers and students&#xA;  acquire their mathematics competence from instruction that focuses on procedures&#xA;  and repeated practice with variation (Leung, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How does this kind of education result in the high mathematics achievement observed? Leung (2006, p. 43) proposed this explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The process of learning often starts with gaining competence in the procedure, and then through repeated practice, students gain understanding. Much of the mathematics in the school curriculum may need to be practiced without thorough understanding first. With a set of practicing exercises that vary systematically, repeated practice may become an&#xA;  important &quot;route to understanding&quot; [...].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The view that repeated practice of procedures leads to conceptual understanding is especially apparent in the program known as Kumon Math.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Kumon Math, published by Kumon North America, Inc., is a supplemental mathematics curriculum for students in preschool through secondary school. The curriculum is not structured by age or grade level, but by a student's own pace, and is composed of hundreds of short assignments that progress through increasingly difficult mathematics skills. Students complete one assignment every weekday and attend a Kumon center for two sessions per week. Every assignment is timed and graded.&#xA;  Students master skills through repetition and cannot progress to a new skill before completing an assignment within a set amount of time and with close to 100% accuracy. New skills and exercises build on previously mastered concepts. (WWC, 2009)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ukai (1994) gives a detailed description of the Kumon method and the philosophy behind it. In Kumon Math, &quot;[c]oncepts are not explicitly taught. Rather, through repetition, learners experience insight. For example, the means of solving such problems as $48\div 6$ or $132\div 12$ will be patently clear, without verbal or written explanation, to a child who has completed several hundred multiplication problems and to whom $6\times 8$ and $11\times 12$ are operations that have been 'overlearned' &quot; (pp. 92-93).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="77" LastEditorUserId="77" LastEditDate="2014-03-24T02:57:20.573" LastActivityDate="2014-03-26T00:03:08.403" Title="What experimental studies have been done on the Kumon method of teaching and learning mathematics?"

(The sales rankings on Amazon.com can be particularly helpful for figuring out which books are popular.) After you've assembled a list of standard choices, order some desk copies so that you can take a look at them, and read reviews to figure out how they differ.  You can choose a book based on (1) what topics are covered (2) whether reviews are generally positive or negative and (3) your perception of the difficulty of the text relative to the level of the students.  Make sure not to choose a graduate text for an undergraduate course unless you're &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; it's a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find some syllabi.&lt;/strong&gt; You can usually find some syllabi online for courses that other professors have taught using the textbook.  Just Google the name (or author) of the textbook together with the word &quot;syllabus&quot; or &quot;course description&quot; or &quot;homework&quot;.  You can usually find several week-by-week descriptions of what various other courses covered, and you can use these to help plan your own course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way, especially the first time you teach a course and especially if you didn't take the course as a student, you may want to err on the side of following the &quot;standard&quot; curriculum.  It's fine if you have your own vision for how material should be covered, but it may be a good idea to try the &quot;standard&quot; approach once before you try to invent your own approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose some course goals.&lt;/strong&gt; This part of course construction is often overlooked.  It is &lt;em&gt;vital&lt;/em&gt; to figure out your pedagogical goals for a course, and how those goals are related to the material that you plan to cover.  For example, my goals for the students in abstract algebra are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Teach the basic material of abstract algebra that they will need for future math courses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reinforce the proof-writing skills that the students learned in Introduction to Proofs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Introduce them to the idea that you must sometimes &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; with a math problem (especially specific examples) before you are ready to write a proof.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My goals in dynamical systems are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Teach the students how to use &lt;em&gt;Mathematica&lt;/em&gt; to model complicated mathematical objects.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Help the students learn to make conjectures and draw conclusions based on experimental evidence.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reinforce the students' understanding of calculus and linear algebra &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that none of the goals for dynamical systems are related to the actual content.  I don't really &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; if the students learn certain specific topics dynamical systems -- the purpose of the course is for the students to improve their overall mathematical sophistication in the ways I have described.  (Learning something about dynamical systems is a happy side effect.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way to choose goals is a combination of thinking about (1) how the course you're teaching fits into the overall curriculum (2) what course goals will mesh well with the material you plan to cover, and (3) what kind of students you will have, and what they need to work on to become better at math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a tentative plan.&lt;/strong&gt; Make a tentative schedule of which sections of the book to cover on which days.  You can base this plan off of syllabi you find, as well as your own sense of what you plan to cover.  Make a note of some topics that are optional and could conceivably be skipped if you start running behind.  You should also make the other usual course decisions, e.g. what kinds of exams there will be, whether there will be weekly quizzes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play it by ear.&lt;/strong&gt; The first time I teach a course, I don't give the students the course schedule beforehand, and I don't announce homework assignments until about a week before they are due.  When you're teaching a course for the first time, you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to allow for the possibility that your original plan may have been overly ambitious, or that you didn't realize which aspects of the material the students would need to spend more time on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also very important the first time you teach a course to have a lot of interaction with the students, to make sure that you know how difficult they find the course so far, which aspects of the course they are struggling with, and so forth.  Don't be afraid to explicitly ask students how the course is going, and whether they have any suggestions.  You need to make sure to find out about any problems &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they become serious issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope all of this helps!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastActivityDate="2014-03-24T03:14:35.627" CommentCount="0" />

I switched to slides a few years ago when teaching a 3rd year course at my university.  Because of how teaching works at my university, this course is one of the first where as a lecturer I can assume that the students taking it are interested in mathematics as a subject in its own right.  That is, they aren't students from another program taking it because it is required of them.  This doesn't mean that they are all mathematically sophisticated -- in fact, they tend not to be -- but rather that they are expected to learn about how to do mathematics from the inside.  So there are proofs, and proof techniques, and the like.  It's also a fairly diverse course with topics from metric spaces to linear algebra to Hilbert spaces.  (Finding a common theme through that lot was one of my difficulties in the early days!)  Lastly, for background, I teach in English but the majority of my students have Norwegian as their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I taught the course using chalk the first time that I taught it, and then switched to slides the second time.  I then taught it three times using slides before it passed on to another lecturer.  The last time that I taught it, I was awarded the faculty prize for &quot;Teacher of the Year&quot;, primarily for that course.  I won't say that it was the slides that won it, I mention that to show that it was part of a general strategy &lt;em&gt;that worked&lt;/em&gt;.  On that, I can also mention that enrolment in this course also increased over the four years that I taught it, to almost double its initial numbers.  Also worth knowing are that I experimented with slides &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; this course with a half-and-half method (on a different course) and it was the feedback from that which convinced me to try the full method, and that after teaching that course then I also taught a lower level course with slides and for that course then I have moved back to using chalk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's what I was thinking when I switched, plus some commentary on whether it worked as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My primary consideration in switching was to consider the question &quot;Where is a student's attention during the lecture?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I completely agree with the theory that students learn by &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;, and I love the idea of an inquiry-based course and of interactive lectures with communication in both directions.  However, I'm not convinced that the &lt;em&gt;lecture&lt;/em&gt; has to be where the students &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;.  In a course like this one, I saw the lecture primarily as the &lt;em&gt;demonstration&lt;/em&gt; where the students would see what they should do and then they would go to their own labs and try it out.  So the lecture is primarily to communicate mathematical thinking.  Yes, a lot of knowledge as well, but never bare facts (definitions or theorems or even proofs) - every definition comes with a story[1] as to why it is that definition and not another, every proof is ladled with detail as to why each step is the natural one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this, then, the desired focus of the students is on me.  I am trying to demonstrate what is going through a mathematician's head when (s)he contemplates a mathematical problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what happens with a chalk talk?  I say something, the students obediently listen, then I write something which the students obediently copy down.  I then wait for them to finish writing, which some do quickly and some do slowly, before saying the next thing which half of them miss because they're still copying down the last thing I wrote.  In addition, some of them are having difficulty copying stuff down because I wrote it in English and their mental error-checking codes are set up for Norwegian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using slides gives me the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No time is wasted through &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;.  What I write appears on the screen so I don't waste time.  I &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; make my slides available in advance (as both &quot;presentation&quot; and &quot;handout&quot; versions) so the students do not need to copy things down during the lecture: they can print them out and bring them along and make additional notes if they want but don't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what the students are looking at.  Yes, when new stuff appears on the slide then the students look at the slide and read it, but I control when that appears and I know what it will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students know what we will cover.  They can see the slides beforehand and read them (if they want).  I also provide references to the text book(s) or other resource pages for background material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students know that they will have the notes that I meant them to have.  So they don't need to worry about missing a word in a definition or misreading a symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not quite sure where to put this next point so I'll put it here for lack of anywhere else.  I only switched to slides when I knew that the technology could support it.  I did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; want to remove the flexibility of chalk so I needed to know that I could go &quot;off piste&quot; if necessary.  To that end, I started out using a graphics tablet with (a slightly hacked version of) xournal.  Once I had an iPad, I switched to that.  My handwriting leaves a little to be desired, but nevertheless is workable.  In addition, I supported the in-lecture material with a wiki and a forum to provide out-of-lecture support.  This is how I got around the perceived inflexibility of slide lectures.  The annotated slides were published after the lecture, so if I wrote something on the slide then the students didn't have to copy it down as they knew they'd get access to it later that day (this is one reason why I heartily dislike using slides &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; chalk, the other reason is to do with the lighting in the lecture hall).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once I'd embarked on using slides, I encountered other advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It forced me to prepare in advance and prepare well.  Since my plan was to get the lecture notes up in time for the students to print off before the lecture, I had to have the lecture prepared the day before, not the hour before.  In addition, as the notes were what the students would see and not just hints for what I wanted to write, I had to check them carefully.  So I couldn't assume &quot;Oh, I know how to do this&quot; and not bother to prepare each example carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It forced me to keep to time.  I integrated my slide preparation with my lesson plan so I had planned how long to spend on each topic.  If I changed the timings in my lecture then I had to have a very good reason for doing so.  Note that I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; change my timings, but wouldn't do so on a whim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It forced me to think very carefully about &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the students could see.  It quickly became clear that the best slide was a blank slide, and that it stops being optimal when you start adding content.  So the trick is to figure out just what you want the students to be able to see at any given point and put just that on the slide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It forced me to think from the students' perspective.  Since slides put me in full control of the lecture hall, I had to think a lot more about how the students would react and what they would need to know and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gave me more flexibility in how to present material.  Of course, once can always go too far (and some may argue that I did), but I think that it is much easier to be creative with slides than with chalk.  An example that springs to mind is stepping through the proof of why the space of continuous functions is complete.  I would have the same &quot;slide&quot; with small changes each time and a commentary on what was happening in each step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, once the computer (or iPad) is in the room &lt;em&gt;and switched on&lt;/em&gt;, it becomes easy to use further functionality, such as animations or videos.  It's all very well to talk about the SVD of a matrix, but there's a nice animation of why it works for 2x2 which makes it much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main disadvantage that I encountered with using slides was the time taken to prepare the material.  And even though I could re-use them the next time, I still wanted to tweak them and so it didn't cut down as much as I'd hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, as I mentioned above then I've stopped using them in the lower level course that I currently teach.  I'd say that my main reason for doing so was that I felt that the students didn't know how to cope with maths being taught via slides.  I don't think that they knew what to do with themselves in the lecture hall: they came to get a set of lecture notes and since that was being provided for them without them needing to do anything else, they didn't do anything else.  So ultimately, whether they work or don't will depend on the students.  The goal is to get the students learning and if they can't or won't learn from slides, there's no point in using them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can find slides from my lectures from links on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/Teaching/&quot;&gt;my teaching page&lt;/a&gt;.  The course that I'm talking about above is TMA4145; TMA4190 was my half-and-half experiment; TMA4115 is the lower level course.  Some of the notes are located on the mathsnotes wiki, linked from the above teaching page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] I don't mean anecdote here.

People who do math play with infinity, shapes, map coloring, tiling, and probability; they analyze how things change over time, or how one particular change will affect a whole system. Math is about concepts, connections, patterns. It can be a game, a language, an art form. Everything is connected, often in surprising and beautiful ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second principle: If we want to promote creativity, we need to let kids know that math is playful. (I think those two principles probably sum it up for me.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="60" LastActivityDate="2014-03-24T17:32:27.213" CommentCount="0" />

I'm mostly trying to articulate how I got to this stage in my life. In a real sense, my answer shouldn't matter very much since the many things that keep women away from mathematics clearly didn't work on me too well, or on the several other women that are currently in mathematics; but perhaps it is still valuable to see what worked for me.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a woman and an Indian in mathematics, the following is one of my 'favorite' phenomena: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat#cite_note-23&quot;&gt;stereotype threat&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a more detailed &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat#cite_note-23&quot;&gt;non-Wikipedia source&lt;/a&gt;. Briefly, there have been studies involving Asian-American girls, where the group who were reminded that they were of Asian descent performed better than the control group on a given math test, and the group that was reminded that they were girls performed worse. It's unclear to me how we should respond to this phenomenon as educators. One possibility is to straight up mention it to students, assuming that awareness might dampen its effects. Another might be to be entirely indifferent to the genders of our students (and play up other similarities. A woman in your class might be the only woman there, but she presumably belongs to shared groups with some of the other students.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I grew up in upper middle class urban India, in a part of the country where it simply never occurred to me that women and men could have (markedly) differing mathematical abilities - gender discrimination abounds in India, but at least in our socio-economic class and region, it wasn't pronounced in terms of intellectual ability; in particular, my elder brother suffered from math anxiety - I expect that my desire to compete with him had at least something to do with my interest in the subject.  In any case, intellectual pursuits were strongly encouraged for everyone. We revered the academically successful students (class ranks were a matter of avid discussion) and the top positions seemed equally distributed (in my high school, there was an award for highest aggregate score in math and physics in our 12th grade (national) exam, and I recall the genders being equally represented. Nonetheless, there were various such pursuits where I was often the only female participant (inter-school quiz competitions, etc.). The OP mentions such environments as being perceived as hostile to girls and women, but I did not particularly feel this way -- while my fellow participants were not the same gender, we had bunches of other similarities, for example, interest in participating in the relevant activities. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as a child I didn't know that one could do mathematics for a living. I like to plan ahead for things (and I believe this is correlated with gender), and my youthful planning for my life didn't include mathematics since I just didn't even consider it an option. My love for mathematics was kindled at a very early age by my grandfather, whose games with my toddler-self consisted of doing additions and subtractions using little circles. Coming to the US as an undergraduate I was excited to learn about the concept of 'double majors' and my decision to pick up a second major in mathematics was motivated in part due to my interest in it, but also due to being a typical over-achiever. My decision to switch to mathematics for graduate study was motivated by the following: math was more intellectually challenging than my primary major (biochemistry), mathematical results contain way more certainty than anything one would be doing in biochemistry, and I just liked my mathematics professors more. As an undergraduate I did attend the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.unl.edu/~ncuwm/16thAnnual/&quot;&gt;Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; which was a valuable experience just to know how many women there are in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outside of my own personal experience, I really like the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs/kovalevsky-days&quot;&gt;Sonia Kovalesky Days&lt;/a&gt;. I was recently involved in an iteration as a panelist, and it was really exciting to see so many young women participating and seemingly having a great time with mathematics. One of the young women asked the panelists to give them names of notable women mathematicians, and I think even knowing about women mathematicians (and women in other STEM fields) would be neat for them. On which note, I'm also a fan of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs/essay-contest&quot;&gt;AWM essay contest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl:dr&lt;/strong&gt; Here are the factors which I personally credit for my being in mathematics:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Being introduced to mathematics as a fun game as a young child&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not&lt;/strong&gt; being exposed to the notion that 'women cannot do mathematics' or that 'men are just better at mathematics than women'&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ability to find other points of similarity with my fellow mathfans, as opposed to gender&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am personally not too upset by competitiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mathematics is generally difficult, so I consider it a challenge&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mathematical results are long-lasting.

But this just shows that two disjoint sets have no intersection!&quot; (In the other words they were trying to say that the intersection of two disjoint sets is not a set necessarily. Equivalently the world of mathematical objects is not closed under the intersection operator. In fact this is a reasonable statement even when we add empty set to the world of mathematical objects because $\cap \emptyset=V$ which is not a set.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had a similar discussion when I explained Russell's paradox on non-existence of set of all sets and I felt that it is completely unnatural theorem for students because they believe that the set of all sets &lt;em&gt;trivially exists&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 1.&lt;/strong&gt; What are effective ways for convincing undergraduate students that the current foundation of math is really &quot;natural&quot;? (If it is really natural at all!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact one can build mathematics in both upward and downward directions by assuming empty set and set of all sets as the basic building block of the world respectively (it suffices to change the interpretation of $\in$ relation). Also there are axiomatic foundations of mathematics which imply the existence of the set of all sets (e.g. Quine's New Foundation $NF$) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Note that the upward or downward &lt;em&gt;direction of building mathematical world&lt;/em&gt; changes our point of view about our actual world too.

We are just using the notions of &quot;preceding&quot; and &quot;succeeding&quot; (in the sense of successor operator in Peano Arithmetic). Using this change in our thinking foundation we can look to the world in an inverse (or maybe correct) way! Living in such an &lt;em&gt;inverse universe&lt;/em&gt; could unfold something interesting for us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Is there any research to show that which one of the notions of set of all sets and empty set are more natural intuitively? By research I mean a poll amongst the society of those who are not aware of the formal foundations of math including little children, usual people, students who don't work on math and math students who didn't see any axiomatic approach to foundations of math before. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Which one is more natural?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;(1) A set which all sets are its elements.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;(2) A set which has no elements.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;(3) Both.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;(4) None.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal limited research shows that the &lt;em&gt;popularity&lt;/em&gt; of the empty set amongst people is too low and amazingly the &lt;em&gt;strange&lt;/em&gt; answers (3) and (4) are more frequent amongst little children!

Unfortunately, having a PhD in mathematics will not guarantee that a candidate will also be able to manage a class of 35 students, be able to design pedagogically and developmentally adequate lessons that progress in units, how to assess students, deal with the requirements for special education (i.e., IDEA) or English-language learners (e.g., California requires a special certification for ELD), and in general survive your first years of teaching without giving up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These skills are usually taught during a teacher preparation program which is accredited by the state and follows teacher preparation standards (e.g., TPES for California). After competing a teacher preparation program, teacher candidates are recommended to the credentialing commission for their state (For this reason, it is not possible to automatically transfer credentials between states. Even if I am a teacher in California, I cannot just walk in an Oregon school and get a job). For example, in California you usually have to take 2/3 semesters worth of post-baccalaureate coursework to be able to qualify for a teaching credential. Each candidate has also to pass 4 qualifying exams (CalTPAs) if you want a multiple subject credential), a basic skills exam (CBEST), and 3/4 subject specific exams (subject CSET) before being recommended for a credential.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are new programs that put you directly in a class (transition to teaching or TfA), but you will have to complete all the coursework if you want to have a credential (you can work temporarily with an emergency credential, but that will preclude you from tenure and to its perks). So, you can be in a classroom without a teaching credential but you will not able to keep your job. On top of that, a public school is not allowed to hire a teacher that is not cleared by the state teaching commission (especially after No Child Left Behind).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Private schools (not public charter schools) are exempt from these requirements and can hire who they deem more fit for the job. They act more like universities in that sense where evaluations by all stakeholders are more important that a state certification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the history of teaching credentials, basic skills exams date to the early 1800s and the introduction to teaching credentials to the 1930s. The credentials were modeled after the medical board licences or bar licences and were intended to strengthen the requirements to entering the teaching profession. Federal and state governments are, however, still working out some issues with the credentialing system. For example, NCLB (2002) introduced the requirement for a content area teacher to be highly qualified in the content area that he or she is teaching. This has been translated in requiring a math teacher to have a math teaching credential. Before that, a teacher with a teaching credential could teach whatever he or she was comfortable teaching (including an art teacher moving to math because her job was being cut) and to have a teaching credential in something (California use to issue general teaching credentials up until 1970's, so it is not uncommon to have old teachers with a general credential). Teacher unions do not have anything to do with credentialing teachers or with the introduction of requirements to become a teacher (they are usually more interested in protecting teachers with tenure). A good reading on the history of teaching in the US is 'Tinkering towards Utopia' by Tyack and Cuban.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree that having a teaching credential does not guarantee that you are a good teacher or know the subject you are teaching, but the same is true for doctors or lawyer. Nonetheless, if you want to practice medicine or law you need to have a licence.

Such a study will be difficult to design and its results will just show some causation between teaching and learning methods, rather than something physiological within the brain. On top of that, research in math education is focused on the elementary grades and most of the articles that cover middle, high school, or college are very rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gardner (1983) has been the biggest proponent of multiple intelligences and his work seems reasonable. The basic idea is that people prefer to learn and do different things based on their dominant intelligence. For that reason, I am good at math (logical-mathematical intelligence), while my sister is good at making friends (intrapersonal intelligence). John Hopkins University(1) has a good page with references on this subject if you wish to research this in more depth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a math teacher, it is your goal to leverage each student's preferred intelligence to have him or her learn math. What I see every day is students that don't have a strong logical intelligence give up solving a math problem but they could explain you word-by-word what they think about a problem or students that are able to solve flawlessly a numerical problem grind to a halt when they need to sketch a net of a solid. This might show some correlation between their strongest intelligence and task performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To give you another example, let's consider polynomial multiplication. To multiply two binomial, you can use either the distributive property, a rectangle (or area) model, or even stack them and multiply &quot;the long way&quot;. The math is the same but its representation on paper is different. I have students preferring one of these three methods. I do not know why, but it could be related to their dominant intelligence (distributive property for logical-mathematical and rectangle model for visual-spatial intelligence).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the university level, I would expect students to pretty much be sorted out of math if they do not have a strong logical-mathematical intelligence. After all, you will not go very far in algebra if you are not able to use math symbols or follow algorithms. You can, however, see the different learning styles/intelligences in action in an elementary class where students use different methods to perform basic operations. One could argue that the selection of math discipline could be an example of different intelligences in math (analysis vs. topology for example).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1: &lt;a href=&quot;http://education.jhu.edu/PD/newhorizons/strategies/topics/mi/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://education.jhu.edu/PD/newhorizons/strategies/topics/mi/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="255" LastActivityDate="2014-03-25T02:59:29.747" CommentCount="0" />

The class size was pretty small, and credit-wise it was an &quot;upper level mathematics elective&quot; (i.e. not a core class), so our professor had some room to be experimental.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like with the Moore method, the students presented all course material. The instructor sat in back, asked questions every so often if the student was not clear enough, helped us if we got impossibly stuck, and participated in the discussion when he had something insightful to say.  We rotated teaching between three groups of two or three people.  Our presentations were allowed to last multiple class sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The class differed from the classic Moore method by loosening the requirement that students prove all theorems themselves, to address the time/constraints issue.  We did have a book, but it was a computer science oriented text that left large holes in the proofs (or omitted them completely).  We had to complete proofs at least well enough to field questions from each other and the professor, which often forced us to create our own lemmas.  If anyone couldn't prove something at the board, the whole class had to finish it for homework.  We were also encouraged to come up with our own examples, and add in whatever cool applications, algorithms, or observations we could find.  Among other things, I ended up proving Chebyshev's theorem (the one leading up to the prime number theorem) after a whole bunch of lemmas, at a depth which I never would otherwise encountered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It turned out that most students learned the material from their own sections very deeply, but did not understand others' presentations as well as their own.  I guess that's inevitable.  Another complication was that some students were better at communicating their ideas than others.  I bet that this method would work particularly well with a group of motivated students that had some previous practice working together.

Showing it is well defined requires one to first prove $\forall x\in \left[0, +\infty\right[ \; \exists !y\in \left[0, +\infty\right[ \;\left(y^2=x\right)$, otherwise why whould $\sqrt x$ have any meaning at all?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An additional problem happens with equivalence relations. In this context, let us consider $\equiv _p$ over the integers. Given $m,n\in \mathbb Z$, the function $+_{\equiv _p}$ maps $\left([m]_{\equiv p}, [n]_{\equiv p}\right)$ to $[m+n]_{\equiv p}$. Even after proving the analogous property to the example above, this has another problem, namely that the function isn't defined with respect to variables, but rather with respect to the representation of variables. Ideally one would write $f\colon A\to B, a\mapsto f(a)$, but in this context we’re actually writing $f\colon A\to B, g(a)\mapsto f(a)$.

The simplest example would be the set of all infinite sequences of ones and zeroes, but I suspect that would be too abstract for small children (and possibly some adults) to grasp without some difficulty. You might replace the ones and zeroes with something more colorful, ideally something that could be wrapped up in a story, but the concept of &quot;an infinite set &lt;em&gt;of infinite sets&lt;/em&gt;&quot; might never stop being difficult.

I think that to do this, you should first establish the idea that there are a lot of countably infinite sets. I'd expect kids to be surprised that there are as many even numbers as natural numbers (surprise them further by repeating the argument with multiples of a billion million trillion, rather than multiples of two). What about an infinite checkerboard (with a top-left-hand corner)? First number the first row with the natural numbers, to make it look like there are way more squares than natural numbers. Then ask if they can think of a way to number the squares so that they all get a number, and if they don't come up with anything, show them the correct answer. The crucial part is to set it up so that they're &lt;em&gt;surprised&lt;/em&gt; that an infinite checkerboard is countable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There might be a few other simple countable sets, and once that's done, you can ask them if they think &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; infinities are the same size. Then you can drop the existence of uncountables on them.

That is, a book which has a small intersection with the courses they will take in the future, but one which they might still find useful. However, such books are hard to find...(my current one out on loan is Yaglom's &lt;em&gt;Geometric transformations&lt;/em&gt;, in the hope that when (okay, if...) they encounter Fuchsian groups they will understand them a bit better...).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would be interested to hear your thoughts and ideas on how to help nurture such students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/160/students-who-know-high-level-math-before-going-to-college&quot;&gt;This question&lt;/a&gt; is similar, but disjoint.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastEditorUserId="169" LastEditDate="2014-03-25T17:07:06.557" LastActivityDate="2014-03-27T08:38:39.757" Title="How to nurture a good student?"

I would think that most of the time you want to test the former. The difference between &quot;not knowing&quot; and &quot;knowing&quot; is usually far more important than the difference between &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;really knowing&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd speculate that the latter depends to a large extent on something that most of the time is quite uninteresting: inherent aptitude. I'm not saying you don't want to know who in your classes is a mathematical prodigy, but I'm pretty sure you have an inkling of that anyway without needing to destruction-test the ones who aren't. Mathematics is a subject in which it's really quite important to stretch the best students with additional material[*], I think not so much with the same material done quicker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't challenged much by mathematics testing before I went to university, and I almost always finished exams early. I don't think it's unusual to see quite a wide range of speed in mathematics (and other subjects). So to me time-pressured exams would have been more interesting and would have showed off what I could do, since some other people would have got much worse marks and I would only have got slightly worse marks due to a somewhat increased rate of errors. But so what? How does that help the class? It's not the only and probably not even the best way to identify the most able students, and anyway one should not design routine examinations for the benefit of the best students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One summer when I was a child (can't remember how old) I did do some time-pressured tests of multiplication tables. IIRC it worked like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;my mother wrote the numbers 2-12 across the top and side of a grid, in different random orders.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I filled in the products as quickly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I tried to beat my time the next day.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I can't remember for sure the rules on errors, I think that any error was a disqualification.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However the purpose was training by repetition (so that I would know my multiplication tables, not just know them in order). Fairly quickly it became a test of hand-writing under time pressure, to avoiding writing any 0 that looked like a 6. The purpose was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; assessment. OK, it's an extreme example of testing &lt;em&gt;purely&lt;/em&gt; by time-pressure since the task itself was trivial (to me at that age) absent time pressure. But I think it's clear that it would not be useful as a classroom exam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[*] &quot;what subject isn't?&quot; chime in all the non-mathematicians. Well, I doubt there's any subject where the best can't benefit from advanced studies, but mathematics seems to have a particular quality that any given material will be frustratingly challenging for one third of the class and boringly easy for another third.

I do know there is research that strongly suggests that different teaching methods at the university level lead to different learning outcomes from the students. For a summary of some of this research, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwslBPj8GgI%E2%80%8E&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Eric Mazur (warning: long) talk about how his teaching changes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/2011/05/12/interactive-teaching-methods-double-learning-engagement-in-large-undergraduate-physics-class/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;There is also research suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;interactive teaching methods&quot; &quot;double&quot; learning gains for students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both of these are relevant because they suggest that there is a body of knowledge that describes good teaching at the university level, and so it stands to reason that this body of knowledge is something that can be taught to people, and one way to do that would be through an teaching credential. I have some friends who are working on this exact issue at a few different universities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the commenter who says that good teaching is not necessary at higher grade levels, I completely disagree. For example, Carnegie Mellon University had a 5% pass rate for their remedial math courses. With an increased emphasis on math mindsets, they have increased this pass rate by 10 times in the first year alone (unpublished research, look for it in a year or so). This says that how and what one teaches matters, even at the higher levels!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Why do universities and colleges not require teaching credentials?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this, I would look at how universities and colleges get their money to operate. They receive part of their money from tuition (ie. which is dependent at least partially on the outcomes of their teaching), but it is my understanding (although I do not have time now to search for the relevant research), that universities receive much of the money they use to operate from operating grants &amp;amp; endowments (often of limited accountability on any measure) and from funded research. Only one of their funding resources has anything to do with the outcomes of their teaching, and so there is less incentive to focus on improving their teaching, which would be the obvious purpose of introducing a teaching certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for k-12 schools, basically the only point of the money given to them (aside from the fact it gives millions of students something to do while their parents work) is that they are expected to teach students. Hence, the k-12 system has a much stronger incentive to require capacity for teaching, which again, the assumption is that a teaching certificate improves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="254" LastActivityDate="2014-03-25T18:32:00.960" CommentCount="0" />

In fact, my last graduate assignment had everything to do with this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that the &quot;Math Wars&quot; in Canada and in the United States are closely related. The debate has to do with a &quot;traditional&quot; vs, a &quot;reform&quot; mathematics education, and stems from an even longer history of mathematics education which Schoenfeld describes very well in his paper, Math Wars: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~henderson/courses/EdMath-F04/MathWars.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~henderson/courses/EdMath-F04/MathWars.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As presented by the media, discovery learning seems to be a method of student-centered teaching and learning, coupled together with a corresponding style of assessment and evaluation. The prevailing media image is that given a problem, a student can &quot;discover&quot; a mathematical concept on their own, with very minimal guidance from the teacher, and be able to extend their abstractions to solve other problems. The motivation behind this method is to have students take initiative in their own learning and gain experiential knowledge. Dr. Jawaharlal explains guided discovery learning in this blog post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mariappan-jawaharlal/teaching-discovery-learning_b_856463.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mariappan-jawaharlal/teaching-discovery-learning_b_856463.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pushback from parents is from a misguided notion of what this looks like. Parents see &quot;new math&quot; homework and don't understand what they are looking at because it is unlike their own educational experience. The idea that their children are not getting direct instruction and might end up &quot;discovering&quot; a wrong understanding of concepts leads to more confusion and backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the missing element in this misunderstanding of discovery learning is the teacher. This is where classroom design has to be done very carefully - the teacher is supposed to challenge understanding and correct reasoning. Parents' notions that traditional teacher-centered learning would prevent this from happening is also misguided - it is easy to just assume that dispensing correct information from the source would allow students to get it right and move on. Follow-up in both situations is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since most parents don't get to see or understand current educational research, their only sources come from what they hear in the media. As you might imagine, media is not very good at delivering a balanced message about this because they often rely on the loudest voices to inform them, and anti-reform advocacy groups will be the one to take up the pitchforks and torches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I neglected to give the journal reference to Schoenfeld's paper:&#xA;Schoenfeld, A.

Research is hard to figure out, and students often don't know how to &quot;work&quot; on a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I meet with a student, I make sure near the end of the meeting to make a clear list of things the student ought to do by next week.  Usually these have the form &quot;work out a few more examples of this&quot;, &quot;see if you can figure the same thing for all of these&quot;, &quot;try applying this to this&quot;, and &quot;see if you can write up this proof&quot;.  You should try to set at least three goals for each week, with the hope that the student will accomplish at least two of them.  When a student doesn't make progress on a goal for a week, you can spend part of the following meeting discussing the specifics of what the student needs to do to work on the goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also helps to keep the student aware of long-term goals for the project.  Sentences like &quot;hopefully you can finish up this proof by December, so that you will have time next semester to prove two or three more theorems like this&quot; can work wonders.  Students should constantly be aware of what they need to get done if they want to have a good project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask the student to keep a research journal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The student should have journal with all of their scratchwork that keeps track of what they thought about on each day of the project.  Near the beginning, you should tell the student that they should try to work on their project every day, and they should make sure to write down whatever they think about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You don't &quot;check&quot; the journal, but usually the student should have it open during your research meetings.  If you find during a meeting that you don't have much to talk about, you can ask something like &quot;Well, do you have your journal?  What have you been thinking about?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you use this approach, students will have trouble hiding it when they don't get work done, so they will tend to honestly admit that they didn't have much time this week.  When this happens, you should tell them that it's fine---it's okay if they're busy once in a while, as long as they get some good work done for the next week.  If they go two weeks in a row without doing much work, you should remind them of the goals for the project, and say that you're worried that they may have a hard time accomplishing these goals if they can't manage to get more work done.  Try not to criticize the student directly: this will sour your working relationship, which is essential to getting the project done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to be available between meetings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I often try to encourage my research students to stop by my office hours for a few minutes between weekly meetings.

We usually only get to talk for 5 or 10 minutes during my office hours, but in many cases I'm able to help her with something she's struggling with enough to give her a few more days of productivity.  I also find out on Friday whether she's done anything since Wednesday, and I find out on Monday whether she's done anything over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your office hours aren't convenient for this, you could try to get your student to stop by at the end of one of your classes each week, or some other convenient meeting time.  But it really does help to have short, 5-minute meetings between the weekly hour-long meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be excited about the project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Excitement is infectious, and it helps a lot to be excited about the student's project during the meetings.  You should express enthusiasm whenever the student accomplishes anything, and you should talk excitedly about potential results that the student might be able to get.

In the article, I share analyses of the interactions among tutors, tutees, advisors, and teacher; the mathematical discourse within those interactions; and the hierarchical and collaborative relationships that emerged over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The piece above fits into a larger discussion of building &lt;em&gt;mathematics communities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For an article in this vein, see:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Walker, E.

This seems backward reasoning to me wherein you know the distribution of grades that you want to give and are figuring out how to design the test to fit that distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your assessment should be &lt;strong&gt;criterion based&lt;/strong&gt;.  Look at your learning objectives for the course and design the assessment accordingly.  For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathsnotes.math.ntnu.no/mathsnotes/show/scheme+of+work+2011&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is my scheme of work for one course.  Note in the introduction how the skills are knit to the grades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In designing the exam, the question that I have always before me is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What competence can I use this question as evidence for?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also imagine the following scenario.  Suppose that a year later, another lecturer storms in to my office and demands to know why I gave a particular student a particular grade.  What will I answer?  That they scored 52 points?  That they hit a particular number of standard deviations away from the mean?  Or that in their exam then they demonstrated that they met the criteria for the given grade?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when I have complete freedom to set the exam and the assessment criteria, then I design my exam by these principles.  Each indecomposable unit on the test will be used as evidence for their grade, but each such unit comes with a &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; grade that it can be used for.  So when assessing for an E, I ask &quot;Has this student shown sufficient evidence that they deserve an E?&quot; meaning that I count the number of answers rated &quot;E&quot; or above.  If this is sufficient, they have secured an E.  Next, I look at the &quot;C&quot; grade.  Any answers rated &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; E are now dropped.  Note that some answers &lt;em&gt;could only get an E&lt;/em&gt; so these are automatically dropped.  I do the same at the &quot;A&quot; grade.  For &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, I take these to mean &quot;almost the grade above&quot;.  So a &quot;B&quot; is a &quot;low A&quot;, not a &quot;high C&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathsnotes.math.ntnu.no/mathsnotes/files/TMA4145h2011eng.pdf&quot;&gt;here's an exam&lt;/a&gt; designed on these principles.  I don't say that it is perfect.  Note the first question &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; asks about definitions and statements.  So the answers to this question can only count for an E, but I give them lots of opportunities to show that they have achieved that level.  The other questions basically allow for Cs and As (one part of each question can be given an A, I'll leave it as an exercise to work out which part).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, if you are worrying about the distribution of grades then you are worrying about the wrong thing.  If you are worrying that the grades are not knit to the desired competencies of the course, then you are worrying about the right thing and the solution is obvious: test for the desired competencies, not for anything else.  And &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; grade by just adding up points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="112" LastActivityDate="2014-03-26T09:30:24.760" CommentCount="6" />

Classes full of highly motivated students tend to give higher ratings than classes of reluctant students.  Students in advanced courses also tend to give higher ratings than students in introductory courses.  If your abstract algebra students consistently rate you higher than your calculus students, that doesn't necessarily mean that you're doing a better job in abstract algebra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be pointed out in any discussion of evaluating teaching that there is no universally accepted definition of good teaching.  You may perceive advantages or disadvantages in your teaching style that the students do not see, and there's no objective way to determine whether you are right.  Ultimately, it's part of every teacher's job to form their own opinions on what constitutes good teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: Who graded the exams?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;dtldarek asks below whether the correlation between student evaluations and student exam scores might be due to instructors grading their own class's exams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cashin's study cites two other meta-studies for the results on exam scores: one by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1170209&quot;&gt;Cohen&lt;/a&gt; and one by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/40195923&quot;&gt;Feldman&lt;/a&gt;.

[...] For the sentence above which purports to define continuity, I suggest you ask a mathematically naive friend whether they find anything odd about the sentences: “A clock pendulum is slowing down from friction. As it does so, it gets closer and closer to the vertical position.” Or ask whether the assertion that “runner $x$ is getting closer and closer to a new world’s record in the 100-meter” implies that $x$ never has a bad day? I certainly agree that a footnote clarifying the Gleason-Hallett definition to say that $f(x)$ need not &lt;em&gt;go straight&lt;/em&gt; to $f (a)$, but may wobble on the way, is appropriate. But whether the Gleason-Hallett definition is correct as it stands is not a well-posed question: virtually the only sentences in English with an unambiguous interpretation (not requiring the use of common sense by the reader) are those written in mathematical jargon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="369" LastActivityDate="2014-03-26T16:58:22.013" CommentCount="0" />

People would get going on the homework right away because they knew they could get help immediately if they were getting stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A line of students would form at the teacher's desk as people got into the assignment and needed help.  After a while, a second line would also form at my desk.  The teacher never even acknowledged that this was happening; neither encouraged it nor interfered, nor even monitored as far as I was able to tell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a student, I was often able to understand what another student was confused about when that student asked a question, while the teacher (maybe because of the age/generation difference, or because the teacher was so far temporally from learning it herself that she had forgotten what was confusing about it) misunderstood the student's real question and answered something else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some teachers would let me break in and answer the actual question; in other cases, I would have to wait, then pretend to be confused about the same thing but ask it in such a way that the teacher would understand and address the actual source of the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One other instance I remember is in 8th grade (generally, the school year during which you turn 14, for those unfamiliar with the American system) we had a section of the class that was accelerated.  One day we had a substitute who didn't know the material and I taught the lesson to the non-accelerated part of the class since we had seen it a few days previous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[NOTE: large-ish edit follows, I just realized that some experience from grad school was perhaps more relevant than anything I'd said so far]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me relate something from graduate school.  I was pursuing a Master's degree in mathematics, and by this time had become reflective enough about education that I started actively observing myself in my interaction with the learning environment.  One thing that I observed was that I was never able to keep up with lecture.  Another was that mathematics is taught completely backwards from how it is naturally learned (for example:  when you are working on a new concept, the first thing that is taught are axioms and definitions; when you are discovering mathematics, you never even think about defining things until you've started to see some significant relationships that you feel need a name, and axioms probably come last).  But to return to the point--it hit me very hard one night at a study group that the only natural way for me to learn was to have someone else start asking questions about something that I kind of have some understanding of, at which point I would start to explain it as far as I knew, and &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; my brain would kick into high gear as it attempted to refine the explanation--at which point I would start actually figuring out the material for real.  In theory, this would work if I could convince myself to attempt to explain something to, say, an inanimate object.  In practice, the only time I do this is when I see someone struggling with the concept and I start trying to help them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A proof is in some sense an explanation, and that did work, too.  But I had to drag myself to the task of writing a proof, whereas if I could see another human being needing help with it, I would work on it until they dragged me away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was one of many people who hit graduate school and suddenly realize that they don't know how to study, because until then nothing had really challenged them.  It was a huge breakthrough for me to see that there was a way that I could grapple with the material that was a natural and pleasant experience instead of &quot;why did I think I wanted to pursue a degree in this at all?&quot;-level drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is an overarching generalization to be made about this series of anecdotes with a self-selected mathophile (and obviously there may not be), it might be that &lt;strong&gt;peer instruction &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; happen naturally, if you don't do anything to interfere with it&lt;/strong&gt;.  Another takeaway might be my school-kid observation that &lt;strong&gt;the teachers often didn't understand what the kids were asking, while I (another kid) did&lt;/strong&gt;.  This experience was repeated many, many times for me, and not just in math, and I saw other students doing similar things (understanding the asker's question better than the teacher did, I mean).  And, the graduate school stuff I mentioned suggest another possibility--&lt;strong&gt;there may be kids that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; learn when they are explaining&lt;/strong&gt;.  In other words, it's possible that not only is peer instruction appropriate, it's the only optimal way for certain student/subject combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="371" LastEditorUserId="371" LastEditDate="2014-03-26T21:51:59.503" LastActivityDate="2014-03-26T21:51:59.503" CommentCount="2" />

I'm ignoring those.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are researchers who teach (historically, surely) who consider teaching to be a distraction from research and so have an incentive to embrace any teaching philosophy that minimizes their efforts, such as &quot;let them struggle with it and prevail&quot;. Putting aside ethical and/or utilitarian arguments on the&#xA;wisdom of such an approach, here too the nature of the course is not motivated by a belief that difficulty increases the benefit for students. I'm ignoring these too.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are various &quot;non-traditional&quot; approaches such as Problem-based learning, peer-learning, constructivist approaches, the moore method (and variants), lecture-skepticism (my term) and others which claim, and can often demonstrate quantitatively, improved performance by students (yet often, interestingly, decreased confidence). They share a de-emphasis on the traditional lecture in favor of students taking a more active role in the learning process (So in a sense, working harder). They often simply require a larger investment of time by the students which might itself account for the&#xA;difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Research suggests that humans have a natural tendency to &quot;skim&quot; when a&#xA;suitable opportunity presents itself, so that increasing the difficulty involved in processing the material (even extremely artificially, as in using&#xA;a less readable font) forces more engagement from the reader/student&#xA;and improves retention (see papers). Similarly, when students have a strong preexisting intuition on the subject, such as when studying newtonian physics (which we all have much experience with), students appear to resist the learning of new concepts that replace their existing intuitions unless actively confronted with their shortcomings (see papers). This also can be interpreted as evidence that learning is improved when students are forced to break out of a tendency to use &quot;cruise-control&quot;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The theory of &quot;cognitive load&quot; has been pointed out as relevant on cogsci.SE, but from what I've skimmed (naturally) so far, the idea is that under increased&#xA;cognitive load learning breaks down. I've not seen yet results demonstrating&#xA;that increasing cognitive load improves learning other then, as just mentioned,&#xA;by forcing engagement.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vygotsky's theory on the &quot;Zone of proximal development&quot; is intriguing in it's claim that learning is most effective when students tackle problems which they &quot;cannot solve unaided, but can solve with some guidance&quot;. The discussion is centered on children's education, it's unclear to me how widely applicable it is to a collegiate math setting. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The related idea of a teacher as providing &quot;scaffolding&quot; also matches up with research on human memory: we remember new facts better when we connect them to existing memories and concepts. It seems plausible to claim that a student who derives a result on his own has built up a more substantial structure around the discovered fact and is therefore more likely to remember it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's an outline of 3 different senses of &quot;difficulty&quot; in learning:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Challenge (&quot;He sets impossible standards, so you work really hard or crash. or both.&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Engagement (&quot;I really have to pay attention to make sense of it, &#xA;it's exhausting!&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Time spent (&quot;It took me 3 days to do that assignment, &#xA;it was really difficult!&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Engagement seems specifically to be an issue of growing importance in&#xA;recent decades, vis the debate on the effects of TV/video games and the&#xA;increased diagnosis rate for attention/hyperactivity disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for answers that shed more light on the issue, point out &#xA;research results and generally make the issue clearer. Though I am&#xA;not an educator (math or otherwise), a good guideline are answers indicating research that would help someone with teaching duties, in math, at the college level, form an informed policy on the difficulty level of a course intended&#xA;(one would hope) to help students achieve their best. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question is admittedly quite too broad, but I care about &#xA;the answer and so I'm asking anyway.  I've done my best to make it constructive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original question on Math.SE was sparked by a bunch of quotes&#xA;I've accumulated through readings on math. I've included them here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is by Lebesgue:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When I was a rather disrespectful student at the Ecole Normale we used&#xA;  to say that 'If Professor Jordan has four quantities which play exactly the&#xA;  same role in an argument he writes them as $u$, $A''$, $\lambda$ and $e_{3}'$ Our criticism&#xA;  went a little too far but, nonetheless, we felt clearly how little Professor&#xA;  Jordan cared for the commonplace pedagogical precautions which we&#xA;  could not do without, spoiled as we were by our secondary schools.&#xA;  &amp;lt;...&gt;&#xA;  Professor Jordan's only object is to make us understand the facts of&#xA;  mathematics and their interrelations. If he can do this by simplifying the&#xA;  standard proofs, he does so; &amp;lt;...&gt; But he never goes out of his way to reduce the reader's&#xA;  trouble or compensate for the reader's lack of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Moore Method&quot; (and variants thereof) is a well known approach to math education.  Here's an excerpt from P.R. Halmos' autobiography &quot;I want to be a mathematician&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Can the mathematician of today be of any use to the budding mathematician of tomorrow? Yes.&#xA;  We can point a student in the right direction, put challenging problems&#xA;  before him, and thus make it possible for him to &quot;remember&quot; the &#xA;  solutions. Once the solutions start being produced, we can comment on&#xA;  them, we can connect them with others, and we can encourage their&#xA;  generalizations. Almost the worst we can do is to give polished lectures&#xA;  crammed full of the latest news from fat and expensive scholarly journals&#xA;  and books—that is, I am convinced, a waste of time.&#xA;  You recognize, I am sure, that I am once more advocating something&#xA;  like the Moore method. Challenge is the best teaching tool there is, for&#xA;  arithmetic as well as for functional analysis, for high-school algebra as&#xA;  well as for graduate-school topology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, here's a quote from the preface to &quot;Mathematics Made Difficult&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;there is no doubt that an absolute ignoramus (not a mere qualified ignoramus, like the &#xA;  author) may become slightly confused on reading this book.

This suggests that at least at this school, a possible future crash in the amount of calculus taught would also not have a corresponding disastrous impact on the amount of math research completed at the school.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, calculus increases (at this school) were mostly handled by increased class sizes and by increases in the &quot;Academic Professional&quot; categories -- employees who are wonderful usually-full-time employees who are teaching calculus part-time and doing other things (advising, recruiting, careers, directing initiative) but &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; doing math research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I welcome and wish for criticism on my methods and conclusions!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="11" LastActivityDate="2014-03-26T20:11:37.270" CommentCount="4" />

He explores predator-prey models through &#xA;epidemiology as well as Darwinism. Dimensional analysis is used &#xA;to derive power laws from mathematical biology and physics (humans &#xA;and fleas can jump roughly the same height, how on earth can that be &#xA;can that be??).

For example you can ask whether a given 3-variable quadratic form is positive definite or not. You probably should warn students that they may need to estimate the zeros of the characteristic polynomial as opposed to find them. Also the students need to recall how to do that - always nice to use stuff from courses with very different topics.

I agree with most of the arguments there, but want to add some arguments that time-pressure is not such a bad things, at least on university level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Assuming a fixed time constraint for the exam, you have three posibilities: Either you risk to have time pressure, or you only ask about a minor part of the course, or you avoid any deeper questions and ask questions about (almost) every part of the course but without going in to deep. &#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The second possibility is bad for those who lack in that particular part of the course and at the same time maybe some students are lucky since they only learned that part. In my opinion, such an exam is unfair (exept maybe, there is one particular main topic which is obvious, or you have announced that particular topic as being relevant for the exam). Moreover, if someone has to build up on your course and needs some other topics, there is a possibility that students might have no clue of that topics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The third possibility is maybe a way between, but if you do not have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; questions with deeper understanding, this is also bad for the following courses as well as you cannot distinguish between good and excellent students. This argument was also elaborated in some answers in the question &lt;a href=&quot;http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/833/what-to-do-when-your-students-are-all-getting-as&quot;&gt;What to do when your students are all getting A&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you want to have a broad knowledge and some sort of deep understanding, you might run out of time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most of the students will be working in industry and economy after their study, where the hiring is mostly based on their final grad in their study. Since it is not only important that someone is able to things right, but also to do things quickly, it is not unfair to also test how quick a student is in solving problems. Also, if two students are able to solve the same level of problems, but one of them is significant quicker, he/she should get a better grade.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even for mathematicans in academia, (a certain amount of) speed is to some way important. Of course, if you are a genius and can work on his own and solve big problems, you don't need speed. But most of the students will at some point write a thesis and have to talk to their advisor. At sessions with the advisor, you may do a brainstorming or discuss possible solutions for a problem where a student can in general not say: &quot;Let me think about it for a few hours and then I will come back&quot;, but a student who is capable of telling quickly if a solution might lead into a good direction has a lot of advantages here. The same holds for discussions with colleagues at conferences. The ability for a quick scan if ideas make sense or not cannot be trained within a few days or weeks and exams where time is also important can help to train this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="114" LastActivityDate="2014-03-26T21:46:28.813" CommentCount="0" />

Perhaps one should not call questions silly, but &lt;em&gt;there are questions which we wouldn't want to answer&lt;/em&gt;, the main reason usually being that it would not be the best response. To name a few concrete examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As a teacher we have a responsibility to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of our students, not only the one who has asked a question and gained our attention.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Answering a question might induce bad habits (e.g. I don't need to think on my own).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With huge volume of questions we are resource-bound to leave some unanswered (e.g. deferred after class, mail or office hours).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To give an extreme example, one semester, during a laboratory-class, I experimented with no-easy-answers policy. It was a curious experience, because during exercise-sessions I would encourage questions, even &lt;em&gt;silly&lt;/em&gt; ones (yes, students had asked questions which were silly in their own opinion or so it seemed). Instead, I told them &lt;em&gt;where and how to look for answers&lt;/em&gt; and them made them search themselves. When searches were unsuccessful, I would suggest better search terms, better sources, or how to check it via some simple test, and so on. Only after a significant effort was put in, I would answer the question myself (the &quot;significance&quot; threshold was low at first and went up as they got better and better).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results were marvelous. We were able to do a lot of stuff, and the students made a tremendous progress (it helped that it was a really good group and we had a good contact). It happened that students did a job so good, that I had to explain some questions to the rest of the group (and why some intuitive answers didn't work) before actually answering them. Finally, the students' opinions were positive, often along the lines of &quot;the class was tough, but I learned a lot, I would recommend it&quot;, some even praising that approach (although &quot;in hindsight&quot;, that is, they hinted that at first it was not pleasant).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, it did work due to specific reasons, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;easy internet access (each student had a computer),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;majority questions were easy to find (for example in the programming language manual),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I was able to motivate the students enough, so that time delays would not break the flow of the class,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;with only a few questions, I was able to focus more on the weaker part of the group, and to keep them &quot;online&quot; even during difficult exercises,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it was a &lt;em&gt;really bright&lt;/em&gt; group.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it was just a single class, so it might have been just a coincidence that it worked and some other approach could have worked even better. Nevertheless, I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; try it a second time with right opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what do I do with a question that I don't think I should answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I answer it nevertheless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, &lt;em&gt;I answer it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Did I mention that &lt;em&gt;I answer it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I answer it after the class.&lt;/em&gt; This doesn't need an explanation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I let the class answer it.&lt;/em&gt; For example, if I fell that the particular student should put it more effort, it works wonders against some personalities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I answer it partially and let the student himself finish it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rarely, but it happens, &lt;em&gt;I let the student know that the question in its current form is inadequate/inappropriate.&lt;/em&gt; There are multiple variants, it might need a reformulation or it may be unsalvageable.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.success.gatech.edu/plus-sessions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; was so successful that it has been expanded and implemented for all the calculus courses at Georgia Tech, and a few other courses as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The PLUS sessions were optional, and viewed as a recitation of sorts. In this way, the standard student of a Georgia Tech Calc I class might attend 3 hours of lecture, 2-3 hours of recitation, and 0-1 hour of PLUS per week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The PLUS sessions were student oriented and student run, with the coordinator being there almost as an icebreaker and inspirateur rather than teacher (in fact, we were explicitly told not to teach). In general, students who attended the PLUS sessions far outscored those who didn't (though this is almost certainly biased as those who attended are at least superficially more motivated). Overall, it allowed professor-led-lectures to be focused on presentation of material, TA-led-recitations to be more around harder questions and second viewings of material, and the PLUS sessions to be where students develop their problem-solving techniques and skills. From my experience, I'd say it was a moderate success, and could lead to something nice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar to this, I've heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pltl.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Peer led team learning&lt;/a&gt;, which is a different model that has also been implemented in university math classes.

The only reason it was a successful program at Georgia Tech is because it was acceptable for students to have 7 hours of class time per week for a (four credit) math course. This would not be acceptable at my current university (where they spend 3.5 hours per week in a math course). On the other hand, in my experience I find that the typical student finishing a second semester calculus course at Georgia Tech is far more proficient in both technique and knowledge of theory than the typical student finishing a second semester calculus course at my current university.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="20" LastActivityDate="2014-03-27T01:01:29.867" CommentCount="1" />

These experiences have amalgamated together into this answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had 170 days of calculus instruction in high school, each one hour long. We used a standard college text of Larson and Edwards (whatever edition it was at the time). There were weekly homeworks, a test roughly each month, and a final each semester (and an AP test afterwards, I suppose). We did not prove things, and we did not need to use the $\epsilon- \delta$ formulation of a limit. In practice, most functions were continuous and differentiable. In fact, most functions were elementary and smooth. We did learn Newton's law of cooling, some numerical integration bits like the the trapezoid rule and Simpson's rule, Taylor series with remainder, u-substitution, integration by parts, trig substitution (to mention topics of various difficulty that I feel might be omitted in some high school classes). We did not talk about many differential equations (we learned initial value problems, and Euler's method, but I simply cannot remember if we did much else).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A very important component that was missing from my high school education was understanding &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; anything was true. We might heuristic our way through things and prove a (small) subset of the things we came across, but in general there were few proofs. Math was a gift, set down whole before us like a swaddled babe from a stork.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With respect to the homework, I never did any calculus homework at home - many of us were able to finish it all during school hours. In this regard, we couldn't have done too much homework timewise. But the homework was graded completely and returned with notes, and we did an incredibly large amount number-of-problems-wise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, university calculus. At my current university, calculus meets for almost 4 hours per week: roughly 2.5 hours for lecture and roughly 1.5 hour for recitation. There are roughly 15 weeks weeks, so that there are approximately 60 hours of instruction per semester. My high school calculus BC course is the equivalent of two semesters of calculus at my university (roughly corresponding to differentiation and then integration), so we should really be thinking of 170 hours vs. 120 hours. (At my undergraduate university, calculus courses met for 6 hours per week and BC calculus was roughly the equivalent of the first semester and the first fourth of the second semester of calculus - the other three-fourths were actually linear algebra).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We teach Newton's law of cooling, but we do almost no numerical integration. In fact, we barely cover Riemann sums at all. The lectures will talk about Riemann sums insofar as to define integration, and they aren't really brought up again. (At my undergrad, we similarly skimmed over Riemann sums, though there was more variability: some professors care and others don't). Thus we don't talk about any numerical integration techniques. We don't talk about &quot;differentials,&quot; by which I mean approximating $f(x+\delta)$ by using some sort of $f(x) + f'(x)\delta$ style argument, whereas in high school we did, including some with multiple steps (like calculating $\arctan{1.5}$ using three steps of length $.5$ from $0$, or something). We similarly skipped Euler's method for approximating solutions to differential equations. This is a recurring theme: we skimp out on numericals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I partially attribute this to calculator usage. In high school, we used calculators as part of the AP test uses calculators. At my university, we use no calculators ever - so no numerics and usually the problems themselves are easier. I don't know whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At my university, we teach $\epsilon-\delta$ but do not test it (a conceptual hurdle that the powers that be have decided isn't worth the struggle, but which &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; skipped at my undergrad). We teach Taylor remainder estimation but do not test it (another numerical problem skipped). This was a large and challenging part of high school calculus entirely missed. (This &lt;em&gt;was not&lt;/em&gt; skipped at my undergrad).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, we do teach first and (some) second order differential equations during the second semester - students learn integrating factor and separable differential equations in particular. Sometimes, depending on the professor/speed of the class, we teach power series solutions to differential equations. The homeworks that we assign were very long (at my undergrad) and are moderately long at my current university. But the graders at both were hired undergrads, for whatever that is worth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And every lecturer I know proves everything from the ground up, even though the students are not held directly accountable to the proof material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, I find high school calculus to be a much better course, with more contact hours, required attendance, more and more completely graded homeworks, and most topics (except $\epsilon-\delta$ and some differential equations bits that are covered in some university classes). In my university classes, we cover fewer subjects, but we cover them deeper (i.e. with proof), but there are fewer (though perhaps harder) homeworks that are graded by undergrads. And we omit most numerics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would suspect a student who got a 5 on the AP calc BC test to get an A or B at the end of the second semester of calculus at my university. But before one concludes that I think high school better, I find that most of my students (including those who took calculus in high school) have almost no conceptual understanding of calculus coming in.

So the &quot;special alphabet&quot; is primarily for &lt;em&gt;mathematics&lt;/em&gt; in your lectures.  (That said, you should cultivate a clear hand writing for normal text but it doesn't need to be as extreme as for the mathematical part.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you never write $\times$ then the students will soon realise that &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; means $x$ and not $\times$.  And I doubt that someone will mistake $x_k$ or $\vec{x}$ for $\times_k$ or $\vec{\times}$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;em&gt;scale&lt;/em&gt; is often hard to see on a board so &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; are not easy to distinguish.  It can be awkward to avoid using these together (consider the common desire to have $x \in X$) and distinguishing them visually can be difficult, but then context can help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some practical tips:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go in to a large lecture hall, write some random equations on the board, and then go to the back and try to read what you wrote.  Then modify your handwriting until you think it is clear.

It's a bit trickier for those not blessed with sinister tendencies, but if you can learn to write so that you do not stand in front of what you just wrote then it will be much easier for the students to see what you write as you write and say it.  This doesn't mean writing with your left hand, it is possible to do this with the right hand but the body position takes a bit of getting used to.  This has the added bonus of making you more turned towards the students as you write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having just given a lecture, I'd add one more practical point: ensure that the board is clean before you write on it.

Here the problem is that many techniques are subject-specific and what works well in a history class or philosophy class may not be so good in maths (&quot;Get in to groups of three and discuss the Gauss Elimination Algorithm.&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I'm looking for is a way in to the maths education literature.  I don't really want to start reading random articles because I don't have the necessary background to evaluate them.  Maybe eventually I'll get to that level, but for the moment I need some guidance.

I'm currently a graduate student but I was once that kind of bright bored student you are talking about. I had my fair share of boredom, lost motivation, exciting learning, disappointment and enthusiastic crankery. I can tell you that taking more interesting courses and finding good books to read will happen naturally - you don't have to help too much with that. Of course you can keep it at that but there's so much more you can do. Perhaps it won't take more than a couple of hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the students don't need more courses or books what do they need? They need a mentor and a friend. They need someone like themselves but who has achieved something in life (If you are a professor that's probably enough success right there) despite difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They need a mentor to help them become a better student. They may be bright but how is their work ethic? How is their stamina and long-term motivation? Does the student know how to keep working on a problem day after day AFTER they've lost the motivation? Does the student know how to openly complain about their difficulties? Those are very necessary skills that they are not likely to develop naturally. An hour a week can make a huge difference for the student over the course of their undergraduate years and it probably beats answering another few e-mails. Not to mention that you get to help shape a promising student into something more than they would become on their own during the natural course of their studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On of the most important things a mentor can do is to take initiative. Schedule to meet each other but not in your office. The office, the desk and the chairs are barriers to communication. With these things you are an authority figure and they'll have a hard time relating to you well. Meet elsewhere and eat lunch together. Talk about stuff - ideally it's not going to be just about math the first few times. The more real and honest you are about things, the better it'll be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bright students need to hear your stories of how you had difficult times or how you tried to prove insert-big-open-problem-here at some point before you even had the tools to work with. They need to hear about procrastination and what they can do about it. Ideally, you'll share some memories of failures past and what you did to cope with them. Hopefully the student will be inclined to share their personal story as well. You might even have trouble shutting them up. If the student complains to you about their difficulties you are on the right track. You'll be someone they can talk to and confide in when the difficult times come. This is especially true if they end up doing some sort of undergrad research and even more true if they go to graduate school later on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they have a good time with you at your meetings they will want to come back for more and they'll want to learn from you and perhaps become more like you. From there on it won't be difficult to inspire them and teach them how to become better mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately my experiences with professors have rarely been this good and I only know about the things I'm sharing with you because of my own struggles as a student and because I've had amazing mentors outside of academia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="390" LastActivityDate="2014-03-27T08:38:39.757" CommentCount="0" />

Our exams are 4 hours long and are not (in the lower level courses) designed to take anywhere near that length of time.  Nevertheless, it is rare that students leave before the time is up and it is still common to see &quot;I ran out of time&quot; written on exam scripts.  So simply making the exam shorter does not remove the time pressure.  It also has some perhaps undesirable side effects.  Since it is now feasible for a reasonable student to complete all the tasks, a good student is expected to do so and to do so well.  This makes the exam even more sensitive to &quot;computation error&quot; than before since a good student cannot compensate for making a few such errors by completing more questions.  Sometimes this is appropriate, but not always.  So shortening the exam not only does not completely alleviate time pressure but also increases the accuracy pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative is that which is (or was - my experience is now approaching 20 years ago) practised by Oxford University.  The exams were designed so that it was &lt;strong&gt;impossible&lt;/strong&gt; to complete all the questions.  Even just writing out an answer to a question without having to think took about half an hour, so in a 3hr exam the most even the best students could do was about six questions.  There were nine on each exam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To emphasise the point: in my year, the best student's best papers consisted of 6 good questions (given that the best of these consisted of Representation Theory and $C^*$-algebras, it's a bit confusing why he's gone in to Differential Topology, but there's no accounting for taste).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This had the effect of replacing &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; pressure by &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; pressure.  You now had a choice as to which questions to answer, and thus could, to a limited extent, compensate for lack of ability in one area by excelling in another (of course, the questions were designed so that you couldn't get away with being completely ignorant of the core).  This was exaggerated by the fact that the final grade was cumulative across &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; exams, not just one; but I recognise that that is not possible in the modular system practised by most universities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on choosing questions to do well on was further strengthened by the exotic mark scheme that Oxford used (sadly, I hear no longer) which put far greater emphasis on completed questions than on partial questions.  So one complete question was worth &lt;strong&gt;four&lt;/strong&gt; half completed questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the purpose of this type of exam is to give the good students sufficient space to show that they are good, whilst giving the excellent students room to show off, and giving the less able students every opportunity to show that they have learnt &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a system where you don't have complete freedom to revise the overall grading system, this could still be implemented in a course simply by revising the grading scheme for that exam.  The idea is to make sure that it is not out of 100 and to &lt;strong&gt;not scale the points&lt;/strong&gt;.  So an A is not 90% but is some number of points (actually, I wouldn't go for a point scheme at all, but that's a different issue), and a B is not 80% but is some slightly smaller number of points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Oxford system, in my year, then one of the criteria for a first class degree was (roughly) to get at least 20 good questions and 20 fairly good questions.  That's spread over 13 papers, so that's just under 2 good and 2 okay questions per paper.  That's from a total of 9 questions per paper, so there's plenty of room there for a candidate to choose their questions wisely, and plenty of time for a good candidate to achieve that level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="112" LastActivityDate="2014-03-27T11:08:48.323" CommentCount="2" />

(The Common Core Standards &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;say as much&lt;/a&gt;, by the way.) Every curriculum or person I linked to above excels at giving kids room to think mathematically about school topics.

I would still recommend preparing yourself for your sessions as well as a teacher would prepare for class. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your student is struggling with linear equations? Go do some reading about the struggles kids have with algebra. (May I recommend &lt;em&gt;Fostering Algebraic Thinking&lt;/em&gt;?) If your student is struggling with rational functions?

Instead, emphasize other mathematical talents. Value questions as much as answers. Value thinking as much as answers. Value ways of seeing, and not just ways of manipulating.

Guilford, gave his inaugural address (aptly) titled &lt;em&gt;Creativity&lt;/em&gt;, in which he called for the concept to be investigated - primarily in terms of various traits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$2.$ Preceding Guilford's address, related work came from the literature on &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt;. Wallas' (1926) book &lt;em&gt;The Art of Thought&lt;/em&gt; is the first to put forth the five-stage model of problem solving: preparation, incubation, intimation, illumination, and verification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$3a.$ There are numerous descriptions of mathematical creativity that accord with the incubation model described by Wallas. The most famous example is Poincare stepping onto an omnibus and having a revelation about Fuschian functions; this is contained in his work &lt;em&gt;The Foundations of Science&lt;/em&gt; in a chapter (again, aptly) titled &lt;em&gt;Mathematical Creation&lt;/em&gt;. This book, and that chapter in particular, encouraged another mathematician to write his own book on mathematical creativity: Jacques Hadamard's &lt;em&gt;The psychology of invention in the mathematical field&lt;/em&gt;. (This is all suggested reading!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$3b.$ For other examples, see Cohen's write-up of his development of forcing (related to my MO answer &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/159935/sources-of-theorem-drafts-by-the-original-author/160508#160508&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) or Gauss' comment about post-incubation illumination, cited in Klamkin's (1994) &lt;em&gt;Mathematical Creativity in Problem Solving and Problem Proposing II&lt;/em&gt; as recorded by K. Knopp:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...all the brooding, all the searching was for nothing; finally, a few days ago I succeeded. But not by long searches but by the sheer grace of God, I may say, like lightning strikes, the riddle was solved; I myself would not be able to find the connection between what I knew previously, with what I used for my last attempt and with what finally succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lesson of $3a$ and $3b$ is that even great mathematicians are (often) metacognitively unaware as to what produced their final creative insight. What's clear, though, is that before the incubation period, one needs to work consciously on a problem (Wallas' first stage). To quote Poincare:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There is another remark to be made about the conditions of... unconscious work: it is possible, and of a certainty it is only fruitful, if it is on the one hand preceded and on the other hand followed by a period of conscious work... Perhaps we ought to seek the explanation in the preliminary period of conscious work which always precedes all fruitful unconscious labor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a related vein, George Polya writes (semi-humorously):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Past ages regarded a sudden good idea as an inspiration, a gift from the gods.  You must deserve such a gift by work, or at least a fervent wish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(For a very outdated and, in my opinion, poorly written article that also emphasizes work, see Adler's (1984) &lt;em&gt;Mathematics and Creativity&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Mathematics, People, Problems, Results v2&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$4a.$ Your question asks: &quot;How can educators encourage creativity without sacrificing correctness?&quot; I think the key is to conceive of creativity as produced by &lt;em&gt;conscious work&lt;/em&gt;. One account in the creativity literature to this end is provided by Howard Gruber; see his book &lt;em&gt;Darwin on Man&lt;/em&gt;, or compare the Gauss quotation above (with the frequently used metaphor of lightning) to the excerpt &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=ZYo5AAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA243&amp;amp;ots=OcakkuMrdd&amp;amp;dq=mount%20olympus%20gruber&amp;amp;lr&amp;amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Much of Gruber's work helps to demystify creativity; to this end, helping students see that even great theoretical advances are a product of hard work and not some magical power can encourage innovation and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$4b.$ For a concrete suggestion as to how educators can encourage creativity, I would suggest incorporating problem posing (not just problem solving) into the classroom. This relates to creativity and the literature on &lt;em&gt;problem finding&lt;/em&gt;; you can find a more extended discussion on the relation between the two in the section &lt;em&gt;Problem posing as a feature of creative activity or exceptional mathematical ability&lt;/em&gt; in:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Silver, E.

(For example, take $k = 4$.) The natural follow-up is to classify $k$ for which Generalization B holds, which is the content of Fermat's Little Theorem, proved most easily (in my opinion) as a corollary of Lagrange's Theorem in a first course on Group Theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2014-03-27T14:42:30.610" CommentCount="7" />

Given a subset $A \subset X$, we wish to define our function so that $\mathbf{K}(A)$ captures the set of elements &quot;close&quot; to $A$. What sort of properties should $\mathbf{K}$ have?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, one might proceed by considering $A, B \subset X$ and the various ways in which they can be related.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What could (or should) we say about $\mathbf{K}(A \cup B), \mathbf{K}(A \cap B), \mathbf{K}(A - B)$ or $\mathbf{K}(A)$ and $\mathbf{K}(B)$ when $A \subset B$? What about $\mathbf{K}(\emptyset)$ or $\mathbf{K}(X)$? What if we repeatedly apply $\mathbf{K}$ to some subset? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These questions can also be thought of (or translated into) sentences about closeness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, the statement &quot;nothing is close to nothing&quot; corresponds to $\mathbf{K}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$.

(2)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to (1) and (2) above, one can similarly motivate two more statements. Namely,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{K}(A)) \subset \mathbf{K}(A)$ (3) and $\mathbf{K}(A \cup B) = \mathbf{K}(A) \cup \mathbf{K}(B)$ (4).

In such a case, we could call $A$ &lt;em&gt;closed&lt;/em&gt; (with respect to $\mathbf{K}$).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this notion of being closed is equivalent to the standard topological one, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2014-03-27T15:47:39.593" CommentCount="6" />

For the last three years I've been competing in higher level mathematics with students around the state of Florida, and I've come to realize that time isn't a very good test of who knows math and who doesn't. Each test is comprised of 30 questions, and an hour, making each question about 2 minutes long. I can say with confidence that on a given day, I can complete every single question on the test, just, maybe not in the allotted hour. On the last few tests, I've come to review my answers after the exam with my friends, as we're allowed to take our test with us after the exam, and more often than not do I notice that I made a simple mistake, like adding wrong. (Mind you this is calculus, so evaluating a definit integral of a higher degree polynomial is a lot of tedious arithmetic). Often do I sit in the testing room on one or two of the harder questions, and after 5 or 10 minutes, figure them out. It feels good, I'll say. There is no extra reward for knowing how to do any of the harder questions, and all of the grading is done by machine. What sets me apart from the students who win, is the fact that as much as I practice, I will still write 2*4cos(72) as my answer, and select the answer choice with 4cos(72). This rush for time throws out the smart students, and only rewards students for being able to be accurate, not clever, or intuitive. Quite a shame if I may say. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent my last summer studying mathematics at the local university, since I am quite passionate about it, and my highschool really isn't.

In elementary&#xA;  arithmetic, the phenomenon of improper proportional reasoning is often&#xA;  related to a ‘lack of sense-making’ in the mathematics classroom&#xA;  (Gagatsis, 1998; Greer, 1993; Nesher, 1996; Verschaffel et al., 1994,&#xA;  2000; Wyndhamn and Säljö, 1997). When confronted with so-called&#xA;  ‘pseudoproportionality problems’ (such as, e.g. “It takes 15 minutes&#xA;  to dry 1 shirt outside on a clothesline. How long will it take to dry&#xA;  3 shirts outside?”), many students give answers based on direct &#xA;  proportionality (i.e., tripling the drying time because the&#xA;  number of shirts is tripled). [...] &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In secondary education, ‘linearity errors’&#xA;  are often reported in the fields of algebra and (pre)calculus.&#xA;  Students tend to overgeneralise what has been experienced as ‘true’&#xA;  for linear functions to non-linear functions (e.g. “the square root of&#xA;  a sum is the sum of the square roots” or “the logarithm of a multiple&#xA;  is the multiple of the logarithm”). This type of systematic errors has&#xA;  been discussed and illustrated by Berté (1987, 1993), Gagatsis and&#xA;  Kyriakides (2000) and Matz (1982). According to Matz (1992), these&#xA;  linearity errors result from students’ overgeneralisation of the&#xA;  distributive law. The immense number of occasions wherein students add&#xA;  and use the distributive law in arithmetic and early algebra is very&#xA;  likely to reinforce students’ acceptance of linearity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Berté, A.

The 'right way', however, presents serious problems. The 'right way' mentality teaches students that math class is an exercise in memorizing and executing a flow chart. This discourages students from actively thinking about what they're doing, and in turn greatly reduces their chances at becoming creative mathematical thinkers.  In order to encourage creative thinking about mathematics, we really just need to encourage &lt;strong&gt;thinking&lt;/strong&gt; about mathematics rather than doing &lt;strong&gt;recall&lt;/strong&gt; of the flow chart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've had success in junior and senior high school aged students by challenging their flow-chart operations on &lt;em&gt;extremely simple questions&lt;/em&gt; (what this means will vary from student to student). For example, I've seen many students approach equations such as $\frac{x}{2} = 5$ by drawing the $1$ into $\frac{x}{2} = \frac{5}{1}$ so that they can execute 'cross multiplication'. The same people might successfully find a common denominator and add $\frac{5}{1} + \frac{3}{2}$ but fail to do so with $5 + \frac{4}{3}$. These sorts of problems are excellent litmus tests for people executing flow-charts rather than thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To challenge the flow chart, one fruitful place to start is the concept that &lt;strong&gt;doing something to both sides of an equation yields a new equation which is exactly as true as the previous one&lt;/strong&gt;. When a student is on board with this (as in, actually has an intuitive understanding of its truth), they're not far from putting cross-multiplication behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This must be done with &lt;strong&gt;prodding questions&lt;/strong&gt; rather than instruction, which is time consuming and, to be honest, a little mentally taxing (trying to find just the right question for student X in moment Y is tough).

It suffices for students to answer just one of them for a full mark. All questions are somehow similar in their statement, but 5 of them are wrong or too complicated and need more advanced methods to be solved. Just one of them is solvable by the course methods. Students should decide which one of the questions is really solvable and worth trying during the exam. In fact thinking on a wrong question is just wasting time and making a good decision has a vital role in their success. The Russian roulette exam is about 40% of the full grade (20% homework + 40% a usual semi-final exam) and there is a few chance for those who lose it to pass the course. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the philosophy of this kind of math exams my colleague says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Mathematical research is a Russian roulette game. All open conjectures seem similar in the first view but some of them are wrong or out of reach because we are too far from discovering those mathematical tools which are necessary to solve them. A good math researcher should be aware of such dangerous open problems. He/she should feel the truth and provability of a question otherwise his/her research effort is just wasting time.

We exercised it over and over again, but she didn't get it.

In how many ways can you go up a flight of ten stairs?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By exploring this problem, students can generate the Fibonacci sequence for themselves, and then it will make more sense when you ask them to &quot;guess the next number correctly.&quot; One of the nice features of this phrasing, by the way, is that only checking what happens for one, two, and three stairs will give, respectively, the answers $1, 2,$ and $3$; this can cause some to guess incorrectly that the answer for ten stairs should be $10$, after which you can suggest the students consider checking the four stair case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More general notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are especially interested in the Fibonacci sequence, then you may be interested to know about the publication dedicated to it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fq.math.ca/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Fibonacci Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Separately, if your question is more general than this particular sequence, a good place to look for patterns is not just in sequences presented without context, but also in the world around us. A nice example of this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comap.com/highschool/projects/mathtrails/MathTrails.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Math Trails&lt;/a&gt;: the full book is available at that link, so give it a glance.

That is, as you are writing at the board, you do not just carry on with the next step yourself, but rather, you say, &quot;and then...?&quot; until the students say &quot;add three to both sides&quot;, when you do that and say, &quot;and then...?&quot; and a student shouts out &quot;subtract $2x$ from both sides!&quot; and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point is that you should make no steps yourself that are not directly provided by the students, and sometimes you have to have the patience to wait for a suggestion, or to prompt suggestions by making things easier. This serves several purposes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students become more actively engaged in the class, and learn the material more effectively. You can call on different students to explain their ideas, and everyone becomes involved. This is also a way of teaching at several levels at once, since the weaker students might understand the specific step, while advanced students appreciate the more general remarks you might explain surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get vital feedback about what the students find easy or difficult. The importance of this information cannot be overstated. If all the students are shouting out &quot;add three to both sides!&quot;, then you know immediately that they know that part well and you needn't spend a lot of time on it; but if nobody can say &quot;subtract $2x$&quot; or the equivalent, then you know what needs more attention. And so when students have difficulty providing the step, you give more detail, and when it is easy for them, you may proceed more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method works with instruction at virtually any level, whether it is calculus or linear algebra or advanced graduate-level topics.

A third reason is that technology changes pretty quickly, so that, e.g., computer use five years ago and computer use today look very different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The National Center for Education Statistics has some data on their page &lt;a href=&quot;http://nces.ed.gov/pubs92/web/92060.asp&quot;&gt;Calculators and Computers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some information is available there from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)  administered in 1990; for example, the site says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teachers and administrators reported that computer access was difficult for about half of the students at grades 4 and 8. Teachers and students agreed that school use of computers was greater at grade 4 than at grade 8, but usage in general was quite limited. A positive overall relationship was seen to exist between the availability of computers and average mathematics proficiency at grade 4; this relationship tended to hold across ability groupings at that grade level. At grade 8, however, there appeared to be no relationship between the availability of computers and mathematics performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculator use in Calculus:&lt;/strong&gt; With regard to Calculus and calculators, one paper of interest is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Penglase, M., &amp;amp; Arnold, S.

Contains 103 references. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Remarks:&lt;/strong&gt; Though longitudinal data are not easy to find, there are certainly a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of studies on calculator use (consider that the one source above has over a hundred references). Below I include six theses that I found on the first page of ProQuest while searching for &lt;em&gt;calculator calculus mathematics education&lt;/em&gt;. Even with just six studies and only excerpts from their abstracts, you can see that the length grows very quickly. Overall, I think the lesson is that there is not substantial evidence for the use of calculators in teaching Calculus; perhaps this may change moving ahead, but these dissertations (from a range of years between 1993 and 2011) do not provide conclusive data for calculator adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;Searching Google Scholar (as suggested in the comments) is one way to find a lot of sources.

Qualitative methods were used in order to provide information about the types of students taking a calculus course for nonmathematic students. The tutorial was used to help the student better understand the use of a graphing calculator while learning calculus. The study tested changes in attitudes, achievement, and ability with respect to the use of a graphing calculator through the use of a post-survey, a pre/post-quiz, and overall grade comparison. The tutorial was not heavily used by the students. &lt;strong&gt;This finding suggests that students are not dependent on the use of a graphing calculator to better understand calculus and its applications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Hunter, J.

The study provides an investigation of the effects on reasoning when graphing calculators are used, since it is proposed that, through reasoning, conceptual understanding can be achieved. Three research questions were used to guide the study: (1) Does the use of the graphing calculator improve high school calculus students' reasoning ability in calculus problems applying the definite integral? (2) In what specific areas of reasoning does use of the graphing calculator seem to be most and least effective? and (3) To what extent can students who have used the graphing calculator demonstrate ability to solve problems using pencil and paper methods? The study included a quantitative, quasi-experimental component and a qualitative component. Results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis indicate that (1) graphing calculators had a positive impact upon students' reasoning skills (2) graphing calculators were most effective in the areas of initiating a strategy and monitoring progress (3) students' reasoning skills were most improved when graphing calculators were used together with the analytic approach during both instruction and testing and &lt;strong&gt;(4) students who used the graphing calculator performed equally as well in all elements of reasoning as those who used pencil and paper to solve problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Nasari, G.

The burdened length of the entire rope thus is the integral $\int_0^l f(ρx) \mathrm{d}x$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A difficulty lies in considering the rope unstretched for most purposes (but this can be given as a hint). To “spice up” this problem, one could attach weights to the ropes (at the end or other positions) or have the rope vary in thickness (i.e., make $ρ$ as well as $f$ depend on $l$).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uniformly accelerated object&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Q: An apple starts falling from a tree at $t=0$.

Start with the most open-ended question possible on the topic, then slowly refine it until it has a &quot;correct answer.&quot; I've outlined an example for a conceptual derivative question below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Start with the generic question: &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about the derivative,&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and recognize that the generic question is not very good because it still has many terrible yet technically-correct answers. For example, a student might answer &quot;Tell me about the derivative&quot; with the correct but unsatisfying&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The derivative of a function is another function, like the derivative&#xA;  of x^2 is 2x and the derivative of 4 is 0.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Refine the question to eliminate the possibility of empty answers. In my example, you are displeased because the student didn't mention what the derivative measures! So you might end up with the question &quot;&lt;strong&gt;The derivative of a function is another function. Discuss what the new function represents.&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; Recognize potential bad answers that are still technically correct. In this case, we have the correct but unsatisfying answer&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The new function tells you how to get the derivative at each point. The derivative of x^2 is 2x and so if you want the derivative of the function at x=3, it would be 2*3 = 6.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you catch yourself just trying to get them to say a particular word, your question is actually a short-answer question in disguise. You were trying to write a conceptual question. In this case we catch ourselves hinting at the word &quot;slope.&quot; Forget that. Put it in the question and ask why that is in there. Our new question would become &quot;&lt;strong&gt;The derivative of a function is a new function that gives the slope of the original function. Explain why, by using the definition of the derivative.&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; This question is getting a lot better but you aren't being clear enough about what you want to hear. So, for example, you might get the following answer from a really good student:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you look at a line, like y=3x+2, then the derivative is [calculation of the derivative using the definition] which comes out to 3. This is the slope, so the derivative measures the slope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am now realizing that what I really wanted was for the student to pick apart the definition of the derivative and tell me why it is what it is -- not show me that the derivative works. So I settle on &quot;&lt;strong&gt;The definition of the derivative of f(x) at x = c is lim h-&gt;0 [f(c+h) - f(c)] / h. (a) Draw a sketch of f(x) = x^2.

Our current use of &quot;sequence&quot; in the theory of series did not become common until later, perhaps around 1900, as did the prominence of the term &quot;partial sum.&quot;  In modern terms, one might say that a sequence or a series is simply a function $f \colon {\bf N} \rightarrow {\bf R}$ -- the same in both cases.  I think the significance of these observations is that a sequence and a series are not (readily) distinguished by what they &lt;em&gt;are.&lt;/em&gt;  They are distinguished by how they are &lt;em&gt;used.&lt;/em&gt;  We speak of the &quot;sum&quot; of series and the limit of the &quot;terms.&quot;  The words &quot;sequence&quot; and &quot;partial sum&quot; began to be used, I suppose, to help clarify the intended use.  You do not &lt;em&gt;sum&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;em&gt;sequence&lt;/em&gt;, and you do not find the &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; of a series; but you do find the &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;sequence&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;partial sums&lt;/em&gt; of a series.  To me, the notion of a sequence and a series are intrinsically difficult to keep straight, the capital sigma being the main difference (or the plus dot-dot-dot).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Difficult is not the same as impossible.  Certainly &quot;the sum of a series&quot; and &quot;the limit of a sequence&quot; are easily distinguished.  I warn my students ahead of time that synonyms are going to be used for different things, and that they will have to make an effort to learn the difference.  I probably repeat it a few times, and I repeat it anytime someone makes a mistake in class.  There did not seem to be a big problem with the terms.  Unpacking the definition of the sum into the limit of the partial sum causes the most difficulty (leaving aside the other complexities of the topic).  I do a few things that probably help the students learn the meanings: quizzing and testing on the definitions and testing them on the proofs of the n-th term test and integral test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how much &quot;convergence&quot; adds to the potential for confusion.  It certainly adds some, but perhaps only a little.  The terms are used analogously for improper integrals, so the connection should make it easier to learn their meanings.  One approach, which did not catch on, is to start first-year calculus with sequences (see Courant, rev. Courant and John, &lt;em&gt;Intro. to Calc. and Anal.,&lt;/em&gt; or Hardy, &lt;em&gt;A Course of Pure Math.,&lt;/em&gt; for examples).  Then sequences are a long way from series in the development of the course.  I suppose getting to derivatives quickly, for the sake of science and engineering students, is the reason for the current popular sequence of topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do find that students' performances on the first test on sequences and series to be the lowest on average.  There are many reasons.  One is that for the students from AP Calc AB courses, it's the first test for which they have to learn new concepts.  Another is that most of the problems have a different nature -- show whether this series has an answer rather than find the answer.  Finally there is the range of tests of different natures: some are for divergence, some are for convergence, and some are for both.  Nomenclature is definitely a factor but not the major factor.  This probably depends on how the subject is taught, though.  Perhaps I have minimized the impact of sequence/series confusion at the expense of something else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do think we owe it to students to teach them to be conversant with mathematical lingo.  I tutored a middle school student, whose teacher did not use the word &quot;cancel.&quot;  The student in all seriousness suggested that the next step was to &quot;s----&quot; it. It sounded like a mix &quot;smush&quot; or &quot;scrunch&quot; -- I don't recall clearly now.  It was a made-up word.  That seems extreme to me.  In any case, language evolves so perhaps the lingo will change.  Perhaps it's worth pointing out that the root of the meaning of &quot;series&quot; comes from a word meaning to join up.  So &quot;series&quot; means the terms &quot;joined up&quot; (by addition) to form a whole.  Sequence, of course, comes from a word meaning to follow and implies that the terms are viewed as separate things.  One might use the etymology to help students think about the meaning of the mathematical terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="498" LastEditorUserId="498" LastEditDate="2014-03-30T18:31:34.797" LastActivityDate="2014-03-30T18:31:34.797" CommentCount="2" />

An extensive body of research over several decades has documented that for many students the symbol $=$ does not indicate a &lt;em&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt; (that the thing on the left is identical in value to the thing on the right) but rather an &lt;em&gt;operation&lt;/em&gt;:  They interpret $=$ as a signal to do something, produce a result.  (I don't have access to a bibliography right now but Carolyn Kieran's 1981 article on elementary schoolchildren's conceptions of the equals sign was the first in this field; it has been extensively followed up on by researchers at the secondary and college level who have found that  the operator conception can significantly impede students' success in algebra.)  So your students may not be understanding the expression $(x^2-9)=(x-9)(x+9)$ as meaning that the two quantities are equal to each other; rather they see the LHS as a question, and the RHS as an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it's almost certain that your students' understanding of what they are doing is limited to a set of rules about what you are supposed to write down where, and is disconnected from any understanding of what the symbols mean.  A phenonenon related to the one you describe:  Students are asked to simplify $\sqrt{12}$. They write $\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \times 3} = 3 \sqrt{4}$.  When asked what they mean, they say &quot;Wait, which number is supposed to go on the outside and which one is on the inside?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third issue (closely related to both of the above) may have to do with decoding the written symbols into verbal form and vice versa.  I have often heard students read $sin(x)$ aloud as &quot;sin times x&quot;; it may be that your students are doing something similar, using the notation $\sqrt{3}$ to say &quot;&lt;em&gt;The square root is 3&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  (&quot;Is&quot;, not &quot;Of&quot;).  In more detail, they may be reading the initial expression $\sqrt{9}$ as an instruction (&quot;Find the square root of 9&quot;), know (remember) that the answer is 3, saying to themselves &quot;the square root is 3&quot;, and write that down as $\sqrt{3}$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The connection among these is (in part) that the square root symbol designates completely different things on the different sides of the equals sign:  On the left, it means a question, and on the right, it labels the answer.  In neither case is it connected with what square roots or squaring actually mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One strategy that can help with all three of these issues is to emphasize that these operations ought to be reversible.  If the student thinks that $(x^2-9)=(x-9)(x+9)$, ask them to multiply the RHS out and see if they get the LHS.  (They are less likely, I think, to repeat the error in the other direction, because they will be thinking $9 \times 9$ rather than $9^2$.)  If a student thinks that $\sqrt{12} = 3\sqrt{4}$, ask them what they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get if they multiply the RHS times itself, and then ask them what they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get if they multiply the RHS times itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Aside:  I once asked a group of 8 high school teachers how they would respond to a student who made the mistake of writing $\sqrt{12} = 3\sqrt{4}$.  Almost all of them said that they would go over the correct process again.  One creative thinker suggested putting both the LHS and the RHS into a calculator and showing that they are not equal.  When I proposed multiplying the RHS times itself and getting not 12 but 36, several of them expressed surprise, not at the method but at the fact that it had never occurred to them before.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another strategy that you may find helpful (over the long term) is to try to get into the habit of giving them problems that are like those they are accustomed to, but with the LHS and RHS swapped (i.e., of the form &lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;_ = $\sqrt 9$).  This may help break the associations &quot;left side = question&quot; and &quot;right side = answer&quot;; at the very least, it may help to bring it to the surface, which can help confirm the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29" LastActivityDate="2014-03-30T15:57:03.633" CommentCount="11" />

If instead you represent real numbers in the customary way as &lt;em&gt;decimal&lt;/em&gt; sequences, the diagonalization construction protocol can be easily designed so avoid repeating sequences of 9s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Explicitly:  Let $ \{ r_i \}$ be any enumeration of real numbers in the interval $(0,1)$.  Let each $r_i$ have the decimal expansion $0. a_{i1} a_{i2} ....$ where each $a_{ij}$ is a digit from the set {0, 1, ... , 9}.  We construct a real number $s= 0. b_1 b_2 b_3 ...$ as follows:  We let $b_i = 5$ unless $a_{ii}=5$, in which case we let $b_i=1$.  Then $s$ has a decimal expansion consisting only of 1s and 5s, but $s$ cannot be the same as any of the decimal expansions in the set $ \{ r_i \}$, because it differs from each $r_i$ in the $i$th decimal place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;repeating decimal annoyance&quot; is avoided altogether because in base 10 repeating decimals only lead to different decimal representations of the same real number if the repeating digit is 9, and we have avoided 9s completely in this process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course there's nothing special about 1 and 5; any two digits will work as long as we avoid 9.  And there's nothing special about base 10 either; the argument will work fine in any base 3 or higher.  The only base in which this &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; work is base 2, because we are limited to only two digits, and there is therefore no way to pre-empt the possibility of ending up with a string of repeating 1s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the reason people prefer to use the binary representation for this proof is because it provides a tight connection (via the use of characteristic functions for subsets) between this result (that the reals are uncountable) and the more general result that the power set of any set $S$ is always larger than $S$ itself.  But depending on your audience and the purpose of the class, that more general result may be both more general than you really need, and too abstract for people to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29" LastActivityDate="2014-03-30T16:15:50.137" CommentCount="0" />

In this context, it is nearly impossible to require students to consistently write formal mathematical proofs during calculus.  At this stage in their mathematical development, students are only starting to become aware that proofs are required in mathematics, and you should be happy when students write arguments that are informal, but convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for this is that calculus is a course that's primarily about calculus, not about formal proofs.  Typically calculus textbooks are relatively low on formal proofs, and do not convey the sense that the entire subject takes place within a formal framework.  Indeed, most calculus textbooks include a large number of relatively informal arguments designed to help the students' intuition for the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other countries, it is much more common for calculus students to have experience with formal proofs in their previous math classes, in which case it may be reasonable to expect student proofs to be both convincing and formal.  The same may be true in the United States for students in an honors calculus class -- even if such students don't have much experience in proofs, it is possible for very talented students to learn how to write formal proofs within the context of calculus, especially if this pedagogical goal is supported by both the professor and the textbook.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for most students in the United States, writing formal proofs is a skill that will need to wait for later math classes.  Many colleges have a proof-writing class for sophomores for precisely this purpose, while others emphasize proof-writing in linear algebra and subsequent classes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, my recommendation would be to accept as correct any argument that is coherent and convincing.  Think of it as more like an essay question -- it's fine to deduct for poor writing, but any mathematically correct argument that's written in an understandable way should be given full credit.

My approach was to use the metaphor of a scientist doing a controlled experiment:  You study a complicated system by introducing a single change, while trying to keep everything else constant, and watch how that change affects the system overall.  In this case, the system is arithmetic, and the &quot;one change&quot; we are going to make is that we are going to replace the number &lt;em&gt;line&lt;/em&gt; with a number &lt;em&gt;circle&lt;/em&gt;:  When we count, we are going to &quot;loop back around&quot; after a certain pre-chosen value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like Ittay (despite our names we are not related, by the way!)

I also introduced the idea of a &quot;7-clock&quot;, &quot;5-clock&quot;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We practiced writing out some basic arithmetic on a 7-clock:  for example, 4 * 5 = 6 on a 7-clock, and also 5 * 6 = 2, etc.  I gave some puzzles, like:  On what kind of clock is the equation 5 * 8 = 2 true?  We discuss the fact that each number on a clock can be given many different names; for example, on a 12-clock we can think of 5 as 5, or 17, or 29, but also as -7, -19, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then we started asking some more interesting questions, like &quot;Which elements are invertible on a 12-clock?&quot; and &quot;Which elements are invertible on a 7-clock?&quot;  This starts to bring out the way in which prime numbers are different than composite numbers.  Another interesting one is &quot;How many square roots does 4 have on a 12-clock and on a 7-clock?&quot;  This latter one is an example of how changes in the ground rules for the system can have surprising ripple effects.  In particular:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Students learn in high school that a quadratic equation has at most two real solutions, and on a 7-clock the equation $x^2=4$ has only two solutions (which can be recognized as ± 2, just like in &quot;ordinary&quot; algebra), but on a 12-clock the equation $x^2=4$ has &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; solutions.  So that means that the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra -- a Theorem that high school students may learn &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; but do not learn the proof of -- must, at some deep level in its proof, rely on the difference between a 12-clock and a 7-clock.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another difference that they can recognize is the fact that the &quot;Zero Product Property&quot; (which is the conceptual hinge on which turns the whole high school theory of solving quadratic equations) isn't true on a 12-clock.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the other hand the equation $x^2 = -1$, which does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have any solutions in &quot;ordinary&quot; (i.e. real-valued) algebra, does have solutions on a 5-clock.

(In particular, the polynomial is irreducible [over e.g. $\mathbb{Z[x]}$].)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, I wouldn't mind seeing a solution like: $x^2 + 9x + 24 = (x+\frac{9}{2})^2 + $ something positive; so there are no real solutions (hence no integer solutions) and the polynomial cannot be factored in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(To be clear: I would not use the $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ notation in a high school class.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a third method, a student might note that a hypothetical factored expression would have to look like $(x-a)(x-b)$ for $a, b &amp;gt; 0$; you need $ab = 24$ and $a + b = 9$, but the latter constraint means the maximum of $ab$ occurs when $a = b = 9/2$; observe $(9/2)^2 = 81/4 &amp;lt; 96/4 = 24$. Therefore, no such $a, b$ exist; so the expression cannot be factored.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The three methods suggested here are similar on a deep level, but how related would your high school students find them?

These seem only-slightly different, but, as we know by now, are wildly different in their effect. Uniform pointwise is too strong a constraint... we often simply don't have it. While uniform pointwise limits of nice (e.g., continuous) functions are again nice, that's not so strongly true for merely-pointwise limits. (Of course there is considerable landscape in-between.) A related issue is, then, that not-necessarily-uniform pointwise limits of continuous functions need not be continuous... to say the least. So, for the principle of interchanging limit and integral even to have &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt;, we have to have some &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt; (not merely definitional) notion of integral for more general functions... which we want substantially to make sense of these interchange-of-limits theorems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One side-effect conclusion is that we want descriptions of various classes of functions with metric or other topologies making them &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt;, in the first place, and then have &quot;integrals&quot; that are continuous linear functionals in that topology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A meta-point that I find significant is that we really did have some issues needing resolution by extending notions of &quot;integral&quot;.

For proofs, certainly one driving force is to cut down the number of assumptions to a minimum so as to find the widest domain of applicability of a theorem, but this may result in a more complicated proof (for example, constructive proofs that avoid unrestricted application of the excluded middle).

There is an undeniable mutual interaction between one's philosophical point of view and his/her approach in teaching mathematical logic. In fact you can teach a particular course material in essentially different ways based on your philosophical interests. Some logic teachers teach logic with implicit/explicit &lt;em&gt;indoctrination&lt;/em&gt; of their personal philosophical point of views to their students. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example once I watched a course video of one of my intuitionist colleagues in his undergraduate &quot;Foundations of Math&quot; class. In that lecture he described the Axiom of Choice as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Axiom of Choice &lt;em&gt;is not intuitively reasonable&lt;/em&gt; because it suggests assuming the existence of an invisible entity. This axiom doesn't say anything about the way which one can produce a choice function. It just says that such a function exists somewhere in the ideal mathematical universe.     &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some years later some of the students of that class participated in my &quot;Advanced Set Theory&quot; graduate course as a part of their voluntary graduate courses. It was clear that they don't like the uncountable cardinals at all. Also everywhere which I proved the essential use of Axiom of Choice in a usual mathematical theorem using forcing construction, they said something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...Thus this theorem &lt;em&gt;is not intuitively reasonable&lt;/em&gt; and we should remove it from our mathematics.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of these students were working on logic. They just passed a few elementary courses in their undergraduate curriculum. I don't know if this is just a coincidence or it is an impact of participating in a logic course of an intuitionist teacher. Based on such facts there are arguments among logicians of our department about possible impacts of this &lt;em&gt;ideological teaching&lt;/em&gt; on students. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those who are agree with ideological teaching in logic courses say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;It is an undeniable right of each teacher to introduce the teaching material by their own philosophical point of view.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The impacts of a teacher's personal philosophical point of view on the students is minor. They can see different arguments in different references which are accessible everywhere. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those who are not agree with ideological teaching in logic courses say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;It is nice to introduce philosophical aspects of mathematical theorems in logic courses but the teachers should be neutral in explaining these ideas because a logic teacher's duty is teaching logic to students not indoctrinating his/her personal point of views.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The impacts of a teacher's personal philosophical point of view on the students could be essential because the teacher is students' main reference and so he/she has a great influence on forming their research interests and scientific future.

A major concern addressed by the project was that after twelve years of primary and secondary education, students did not understand the basic mathematics necessary to function effectively in society, and that the performance of mathematics in the national examination was low compared to other subjects.  The project's aim was to strengthen mathematics and science at the secondary level through the systematic in-service training (INSET) of teachers.

One of the best of this kind is &quot;for any integer $n$, if $n$ is a multiple of 4 then $n^2$ also is a multiple of 4&quot;: you have all three cases where implication is true by taking $n=2,3,4$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second angle is to give an example where one wants to state and use an implication without knowing the truth value of its terms. Here ironically, an allegedly real-life assertion does the job quite beautifully: assume you are investigating a murder that took place in London Saturday and that Colonel Mustard is a suspect. You can say confidently that &quot;if Colonel Mustard is guilty, then she was in London Saturday&quot; even if you do not know whether she is guilty nor whether she was in London Saturday. What is especially good in this example is that it is a good way to introduce contrapositives: the statement &quot;if Colonel Mustard was not in London Saturday then she is not guilty&quot; shows convincingly that the contrapositive has the same truth value than the original implication.

First I'd say that ideological teaching is not restricted to logic. Granted, it is more likely to encounter ideology in a logic class, but not only there. I've had a lecturer in differential equations who told us that all of mathematics is basically concerned with solving differential equations (this exaggeration did not serve to make the course more interesting than it was (and it was, perhaps not to all students, but it was)). I've heart algebra enthusiasts bad-mouth the concreteness of analysis and analysts bad-mouth the abstractness of algebra. I guess it is only natural, but should be avoided. I think it is obvious that some of the (dis)advantages of ideological teaching is that it may alienate some students and draw others to the subject matter. The thing is you don't know what will happen to which student. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could it be harmful/useful for students? Yes, it can be both harmful and useful. If your ideology closely fits that of the mainstream and you thus push a good student to pursue working on a problem many people appreciate, then you (probably) increase their potential for landing a job. On the other hand, if you discourage a good student from following a seemingly tangential area of mathematics that ends up being really important then it may do harm. As said above, it is very difficult to know in advance. But, in my opinion, ideology should be presented as such. I may like or dislike the axiom of choice, but what I teach should reflect (largely) the mainstream. I may provide my own opinion of course, but present it as such. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does it have a notable impact on students' research interests in future? It certainly might (as the cases you describe would indicate). In my experience, some students are highly influenced by peers and experts while others are less so. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there any math education long term research to determine the similarity of students and teachers' point of views in logic and philosophy of mathematics?

But speaking as someone who unfortunately was never gifted or particularly proficient at it but can sometimes see the beauty of math, I do have some advice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that the times in my education when I felt most disconnected, disinterested and even disgruntled with math were the times when I felt that I was being told to learn things without being helped or allowed to understand their beauty or utility, especially when I felt I wasn't being given the &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to do so. &#xA;I hated the times when I felt that I was being made to learn without regards for my curiosity instead of through it or because of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the times that I felt the most uplifted and filled with wonder were when I was taught something that brought down barriers, that allowed me to solve problems I'd have written off as unsolvable before. For example, learning long division after spending so long dealing with remainders. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also uplifting are times when the amazing &lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;endless order&lt;/em&gt; of math revealed itself to me. Playing with  fractions and finding the different relationships between the numbers chosen and the fraction's value as a decimal--for example, seeing the way that the decimal forms of a series like (2/1, 3/2, 4/3, 5/6, etc. 'walk' their way downwards and trying to find the rules that governed such things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Word problems can be engaging, but they should be something that makes the student care &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; about the answer, not just something that gives a flimsy and petty pretext for why the math needs to be done. The latter can actually make doing the problem seem less worthwhile. Less &quot;A train leaves Detroit...&quot; and more &quot;Can this man get to the airport to stop the woman he loves leaving forever?!&quot; Less &quot;How much fence do you need for this garden&quot; and more &quot;What's the largest enclosure this tiger can have at this zoo without being able to escape with a running jump?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the times I loved were when I was being shown not just the what, when and where of numbers, but the why and the how. There's no need to include God in the &quot;who&quot; position, just try to let the students see the beautiful patterns in the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="579" LastActivityDate="2014-04-01T05:46:12.920" CommentCount="1" />

In an elementary linear algebra course, particularly for non-mathematicians, then I think that determinants are as useful as your appendix[1].  Nevertheless, they are on the syllabus so I have to teach them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's what I do.  I tell the students the truth: that determinants used to be a key part of doing computations with matrices but now there are better methods, however that they will still need to compute some determinants on an exam.  Then I tell them how to compute them using Gaussian Elimination, and the tricks for 2x2 and 3x3 (emphasising that they are tricks, and that there is no such trick for 4x4 or higher).  If time, I might mention the relationship to volume but I wouldn't regard it as important particularly as up to this point we won't have talked about geometry at all.  I certainly wouldn't bother with Cramner's rule.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my current course, I have four hours set aside for determinants.  The above takes a little over one.  I use the rest of the time for more useful things like going back over topics that the students have had issues with earlier in the semester.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of useful nuggets to reinforce the &lt;em&gt;down with determinants&lt;/em&gt; line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myth: &quot;Determinants are useful to figure out if a matrix is invertible or not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, in &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;, maybe.  But in practice, no.  How do we compute the determinant?  Generally, by using Gaussian Elimination but remembering row swaps and row scales.  But Gaussian Elimination tells us &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; whether or not the matrix is invertible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myth: &quot;Determinants are useful for finding eigenvalues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, this is true in theory, but not in practice.  It's fine with 2x2, and with 3x3 if you give them a running start (such as an obvious root).  But any higher and you're in dubious territory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a few years ago I looked up how one of the major mathematical pieces of software found roots of polynomials.  What I found surprised me, and put the final nail in determinant's coffin.  To find the roots of an arbitrary polynomial, this program figures out a matrix with that as its characteristic polynomial.  Then does an iterative method to find the eigenvalues of that matrix, and returns them as the roots of the polynomial.  I leave it as an exercise to the reader to see how this shows the idiocy of teaching determinants as a method for finding eigenvalues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] I want to make it clear that this is about determinants in such a course.  As a differential topologist, I'm fully aware of the usefulness of determinants in other arenas.

Take everything with the appropriate level of salt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A great theme to try and convey throughout a linear algebra course is that sometimes it is fruitful to try to understand a mathematical object by characterizing properties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first example students would probably see in a first linear algebra course is the formula for matrix multiplication.  If you give the definition as the formula, it is incomprehensible.  Why would anyone ever perform this horrible operation?  On the other hand, if you define matrix multiplication as the matrix which results from composing the linear maps they represent, it is totally motivated.  This definition seems less &quot;computational&quot;, but it is actually just as good for computation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The determinant provides another great example of something which is best understood through properties which characterize it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Start with the motivation that for vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we want to define the signed&#xA;volume of the parallelepiped spanned by an &lt;strong&gt;ordered&lt;/strong&gt; list of vectors $(v_1,v_2,...,v_n)$. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We should have &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;$D(e_1,e_2,...,e_n) = 1$&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Switching two inputs should negate the output (The determinant is &lt;strong&gt;alternating&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The determinant is linear in each vector input separately (This requires some&#xA;carefully drawn pictures)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now have them break up into groups and try to compute some determinants using these properties.  Since the only value they know is on the ordered list of basis&#xA;vectors, they must proceed by using multilinearity reduce to basis vectors, and then the alternating property to put them into the correct order.  For example, you might have them compute&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$&#xA;\begin{align*}&#xA;D\left(\begin{bmatrix}2\\3\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}4\\5\end{bmatrix}\right)&#xA;&amp;amp;=D\left(2\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}+3\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}4\\5\end{bmatrix}\right)\\&#xA;&amp;amp;=2D\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}4\\5\end{bmatrix}\right)+3D\left(\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}4\\5\end{bmatrix}\right)\\&#xA;&amp;amp;=(2)(4)D\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}\right)+(2)(5)D\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\right)+(3)(4)D\left(\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}\right)+ (3)(5)D\left(\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\right)\\&#xA;&amp;amp;=2(5) -3(4)\\&#xA;&amp;amp;=-2&#xA;\end{align*}&#xA;$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really think that this kind of computation, where each step is dictated by the properties of the determinant, is essential.  For some reason, I have not really seen this kind of computation in any linear algebra book.  It is usually only shown in the general case, as part of the proof that the determinant is characterized by these properties, and I think students often &quot;turn off&quot; for proofs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is as far as I wanted to go in my comment in the other thread that the &quot;computation of the determinant is clear from its characterizing properties&quot;.  I do think covering all of the things you mention in a week is probably a bit much.  So far, the above presentation has covered the volume aspect, and how to compute them.  It also follows cleanly from these properties that if one vector is in the span of the others, then the determinant is zero.  This is also clear geometrically.  This shows that if the corresponding matrix is not injective, the determinant must be zero.  It also shows why column operations do not effect the determinant. Cramer's rule is also a very short computation from these properties.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I must admit, the other topics you mention (row operations, cofactor expansion, and classical adjoint) all seem somewhat tricky from this perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="117" LastActivityDate="2014-04-01T14:44:52.170" CommentCount="0" />

Namely, starting with (ambiguously) nice functions $f_n$, perhaps continuous and compactly supported on a Euclidean space, so that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; notion of integral makes sense for the individuals, _one_thing_ we want is that $\lim_n \int f_n=\int\lim_n f_n$. Part of the issue is in what sense the limit of the functions themselves is taken, and there is not a unique answer to this. But it is clear from examples that pointwise limits of continuous functions may be harder to sensibly integrate in naive terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another fundamental issue is the distinction between integrating differential forms and integrating functions, although again I claim this is more of a technical distinction than fundamental. Namely, while from a &quot;measure-theory&quot; viewpoint integrating $f$ on an interval $[a,b]$ does not even &lt;em&gt;mention&lt;/em&gt; direction, in usual calculus, and if we imagine we are integrating the differential form $f\,dx$, direction &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter. (That is, in elementary calculus the integral $\int_a^b$ is the negative of $\int_b^a$.) This issue is still more notational than substantive even when doing path integrals and surface integrals. It seems to me that the issue is serious only when we are doing calculus on manifolds, where there is no canonical coordinate system, so that a differential form has no canonical local expression, and the only thing that is well-defined is an integral of an exterior $k$-form over a $k$-cycle or $k$-current, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, in all cases, the external properties and desiderata are very similar, so that all these things are more the same than different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even when (as in basic Lebesgue theory) we discover that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; restrictions are necessary to be able to pass a linear operator inside an integral, it seems to me that the development of mathematics has been to make sense of otherwise-dubious outcomes, whenever possible. For example, $\int_{\mathbb R} {e^{ix\xi}\;dx\over 1+x^2}$ cannot be differentiated with respect to $\xi$ very much without producing a not-classically-sensible integral.

As a class exercise, I ask them to propose functions $f$ and numbers $c$, usually with the requirement that $c$ be in the domain of $f$, that show all four possible logical combinations (true/false) of the hypothesis (diff.) and conclusion (cont.).  Of course one combination is impossible (true implies false). This then becomes the basis for discussing logical implication.  The use of specific examples more or less finesses the quantifiers per se, which won't be covered until later.  It is a familiar theorem to the students, so the students' attention is easily focused on the properties of implication.  And they readily understand that if it is a theorem, it should be true for all functions and values.

Should we say that a fraction like $\frac{1}{2}$ &quot;is&quot; a number, or &quot;represents&quot; a number?  In particular, should we say that $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{2}{4}$ &quot;are&quot; the same number, or &quot;represent&quot; the same number?  (Or something else entirely?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My immediate reaction on hearing the question was that &quot;obviously&quot; they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the same number.  I would explain the difference between $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{2}{4}$ as being analogous to the fact that one person can have two names.  If I go by &quot;Mike&quot; to my friends and &quot;Dr. Shulman&quot; to my students, and one of my friends is talking about me to one of my students, they might end up having to explain that &quot;Mike and Dr. Shulman are the same person.&quot;  They wouldn't say &quot;Mike and Dr. Shulman represent the same person.&quot;  They might say &quot;'Mike' and 'Dr. Shulman' are names for the same person&quot;, which conveys about the same meaning as the latter, but in that case the two names would be quoted, because we're talking about them as bits of syntax rather than about the objects they denote.  But when a name is not quoted, we're talking about its denotation rather than the name itself, e.g. when we say &quot;$\frac{1}{2}$ is between 0 and 1&quot; we don't mean that the symbol &quot;$\frac{1}{2}$&quot; is written in between the symbols &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; on a sheet of paper, we mean that the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; denoted by &quot;$\frac{1}{2}$&quot; lies in between the numbers denoted by &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; with respect to the ordering of rational numbers.  So we can say &quot;$\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{2}{4}$ are the same number&quot; but &quot;'$\frac{1}{2}$' and '$\frac{2}{4}$' represent the same number&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this is just my intuitive reaction based on experience as a mathematician, and I've never actually tried to teach someone about fractions.  I certainly wouldn't want to try to explain sense and reference to a third grader!  So I'm curious about the consensus (or lack thereof) of people who do teach fractions and study people's understanding of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="38" LastActivityDate="2014-04-03T21:16:40.107" Title="Should we say that fractions &quot;are&quot; or &quot;represent&quot; numbers?"

Let me to add some brief additional points to other useful answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. How can I add spiritual aspects to my mathematics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spirituality of your mathematics comes from your &lt;em&gt;meta-mathematics&lt;/em&gt;. By meta-mathematics I mean all parts of human knowledge which discuss &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; mathematics including logic, philosophy of math, etc. It is a very important point. Your meta-mathematics determines the &lt;em&gt;interpretation&lt;/em&gt; of the mathematical theorems which you teach. In fact, one can talk about all beautiful theorems of mathematics and all religious mathematicians of the history without any spiritual impact on his students when he doesn't use a spiritual meta-mathematics. Simply because beauty of a subject/object cannot lead one to any spiritual experience necessarily. Can looking to a beautiful flower convince somebody that there are some spiritual beings? Not necessarily. The same situation happens when one tries to increase the spiritual aspects of his teaching just by showing the beauty of mathematical theorems to his student. Also in the case of talking about faithful mathematicians there are many counterexamples for each religious person. For example in logic if you mention Cantor and Godel as religious logicians another one can mention Russell and Turing as counterexamples. All of these persons are great logicians with brilliant deep works. Thus the technical theorems of logic/mathematics &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; lead one to believe in God or any other immaterial existence necessarily. You need &lt;em&gt;endow&lt;/em&gt; your mathematics with an appropriate &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt; to conclude such conclusions. If you choose a suitable spiritual philosophy of math as the standard philosophy of your courses then all of your lectures, theorems, proofs, discussions and activities seem really spiritual and leads your students to a spiritual experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What is the best meta-mathematics for a spiritual teaching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Platonism&lt;/a&gt; is a good option because:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;As a possible consequence of Plato's travels to the Eastern countries including Jerusalem (and maybe Persia) and meeting with Rabbis and Zoroastrian clergies his philosophical point of view is designed based on a &lt;em&gt;pyramid&lt;/em&gt;. Plato's philosophical system implicitly leads one to a &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; point on the top of this pyramid (&lt;em&gt;Plato's God&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Platonism suggests a clear pattern for &lt;em&gt;uplifting&lt;/em&gt;. In Plato's point of view, the role of mathematics in one's spiritual travel from earth to the ideal world of ideas (&lt;em&gt;Plato's heaven&lt;/em&gt;) is very important. Mathematics is a &lt;em&gt;bridge&lt;/em&gt; in the route and maybe the last one of them in the modern age.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Based on Platonic point of view, mathematical objects and theorems are &lt;em&gt;discoveries&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;inventions&lt;/em&gt;. For those who believe in Platonism, each new theorem is a fact about the &lt;em&gt;invisible&lt;/em&gt; world of mathematical objects.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In Platonism, doing mathematics is a kind of &lt;em&gt;praying&lt;/em&gt; (or meditation) which helps one to understand the &lt;em&gt;absolute truth&lt;/em&gt; of the world. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 1.&lt;/strong&gt; The ideas of Pythagoras about the interactions of mathematics and world are related. Also the philosophy and theosophy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotinus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Plotinus&lt;/a&gt; and other philosophers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;neoplatonism&lt;/a&gt; could be related and very useful.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How should I use the spiritual meta-mathematics in my teaching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In one word, &lt;em&gt;implicitly&lt;/em&gt;. Generally, there is no need to talk about Socrates, Plato, Pythagoras, Plutinus, Cantor, Godel or any other philosopher or mathematician in your teaching. (In special cases, for example when you are teaching special courses like logic or set theory, it is relevant and useful to refer to life and belief of some persons directly but it is irrelevant in usual math courses like calculus and linear algebra). What you need is just a Platonic approach and explaining his ideas about mathematics and mathematical objects in your implicit comments. Just as an example when you are talking about a particular mathematical object/theorem you can use a sentence in the following form:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In 1963, Paul Cohen &lt;em&gt;discovered&lt;/em&gt; the Forcing method and a new model of ZFC and finally &lt;em&gt;found&lt;/em&gt; the solution of one of the most important questions of 20th century. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compare with this one:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In 1963, Paul Cohen &lt;em&gt;constructed&lt;/em&gt; a new model of ZFC by &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; Forcing method and &lt;em&gt;solved&lt;/em&gt; one of the most important questions of 20th century. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asking questions&lt;/em&gt; instead of expressing a sentence explicitly could be another useful method to lead students to build their own spiritual world. For example you can say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What phenomenon does Cantor's theorem on existence of more than one infinity, describe? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compare with this one:       &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cantor's theorem on existence of more than one infinity says there are some infinite and immaterial worlds beyond our finite materialistic universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can find more useful techniques to make your teaching as &lt;em&gt;mysterious&lt;/em&gt; as possible. Let students be free to have their ideas and imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Note that spirituality is an internal experience of each person. You cannot and should not &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; them to believe on existence of immaterial objects including God, Gabriel, $\pi$, $\aleph_1$, etc. What you can do is just &lt;em&gt;motivating&lt;/em&gt; them to &lt;em&gt;explore&lt;/em&gt; inside their minds and hearts to find these beings and unfold the invisible objects of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 3.&lt;/strong&gt; Note that what you want to do is an &lt;em&gt;ideological teaching&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of what I described in my post &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/1100/ideological-teaching-in-logic-courses&quot;&gt;Ideological Teaching in Logic Courses&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. This is not easy. You should be aware of possible negative and inverse impacts of this approach. Detect the feedback of your audiences continuously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Do some fields of mathematics have more potential to be interpreted spiritually?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course. The nature of some parts of mathematics is very adequate for spiritual interpretations. You can use this potential in your teaching by leading your students to these realms. For example in set theory you don't need to do too much effort to bring spirituality in your teaching. Almost all textbooks are full of the comments with explicit or implicit references to religious and Platonic beliefs. Here are some of the quotations from usual textbooks of set theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;..., Kunen's result (Kunen inconsistency theorem) can best be viewed as an ultimate limitation imposed by the Axiom of Choice on the extent of reflection possible in the universe. ‎$‎ZFC‎$ ‎rallies ‎at ‎last ‎to ‎force a‎ ‎veritable ‎&lt;strong&gt;Gotterdammerung&lt;/strong&gt;‎ ‎for ‎large ‎cardinals!‎ [&lt;em&gt;Akihiro Kanamori, The Higher Infinite, Page 324&lt;/em&gt;]‎&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;...,‎Cantor came to view the finite and the transfinite as all of a piece, similarly comprehendable within mathematics, and delimited by what he termed the ‎&lt;strong&gt;absolute&lt;/strong&gt;‎ which he associated mathematically with the class of all ordinals and metaphysically with ‎&lt;strong&gt;God&lt;/strong&gt;‎.

[&lt;em&gt;Kenneth Kunen, Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs, Page 193&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 4.&lt;/strong&gt; ‎Note ‎that ‎what ‎Kunen ‎describes ‎in the ‎above ‎paragraph ‎as a‎ ‎&lt;em&gt;forcing language&lt;/em&gt; ‎for ‎the &lt;em&gt;people living in&lt;/em&gt; ‎$‎‎M$‎ ‎is very similar to what we call &lt;em&gt;religion&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;our world&lt;/em&gt;. Precisely a religion consists from sentences about &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt; of some beings (such as &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gabriel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Satan&lt;/em&gt;, ...) which some people of &lt;em&gt;our world&lt;/em&gt; believe on &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; that they exist but they don't know precisely what these beings are. However people can describe some of properties and relations of these creatures using their &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt; such as: &quot;&lt;em&gt;Satan is the enemy of God&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. So religion and science are both a collection of sentences in the language of people living in our world with a difference that &lt;em&gt;using names of generic objects which don't belong to our world&lt;/em&gt; are allowed in religion but in science every sentence must use &lt;em&gt;names of real objects which are members of our world&lt;/em&gt; like any materialistic creature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;..., Philosophical positions on the foundations of mathematics have more marked impact on set theory than anywhere else in mathematics; and the reader should be well aware of the prejudices of the author he is reading. I have written this book from an   uncompromisingly realist or ‎&lt;strong&gt;Platonist&lt;/strong&gt; position; that is, I have taken the viewpoint that in some sense sets do exist, as objects to be studied, and that set theory is just as much about fixed objects as is number theory. ..., ‎It seems very difficult to me to give any reason‎ for the study of large cardinals without taking a viewpoint of this sort. &quot; [&lt;em&gt;Frank Drake, An Introduction to Large Cardinals, Page VIII&lt;/em&gt;]‎ &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;..., The ‎&lt;strong&gt;Platonists&lt;/strong&gt;‎ of ‎$‎2100‎$‎ may know whether ‎$‎CH‎$‎ is true, but neither ‎$‎CH‎$‎ nor ‎$‎\neg CH‎$‎ will ever be a formal theorem of ‎$‎ZFC‎$‎. Likewise, many &lt;strong&gt;Platonists&lt;/strong&gt; of today‎ &lt;strong&gt;believe&lt;/strong&gt; that inaccessible cardinals &lt;strong&gt;exist&lt;/strong&gt;, even though the statement that they exist is not a formal theorem of ‎$‎ZFC‎$‎. ‎[&lt;em&gt;Keneth Kunen, Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs, Page 11&lt;/em&gt;]‎&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;..., So our results are actually relative consistency results - i.e., predicated upon the assumption that ‎$‎ZF^{-}‎$‎ is consistent. These relative consistency results will be accomplished by completely finitistic means, whereas the consistency of $‎ZF^{-}‎$ will remain either an open question or an article of ‎&lt;strong&gt;faith&lt;/strong&gt;‎, depending upon one's philosophy. [&lt;em&gt;Kenneth Kunen, Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs, Page 111&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 5.&lt;/strong&gt;‎ You can find more information about the religious backgrounds of set theory in these books:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0743422996&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Amir Aczel, &lt;em&gt;The Mystery of the Aleph: Mathematics, the &lt;strong&gt;Kabbalah&lt;/strong&gt;, and the Human Mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0674032934&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Loren Graham, Jean-Michel Kantor, &lt;em&gt;Naming Infinity: A True Story of &lt;strong&gt;Religious Mysticism&lt;/strong&gt; and Mathematical Creativity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. How can I prove existence of spiritual beings to my students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; need to prove any thing! &lt;em&gt;The faith begins when the proof fails!&lt;/em&gt; In fact the scientific and mathematical proofs as &lt;em&gt;finite&lt;/em&gt; sequences of valid sentences based on a reasonable set of axioms, are too &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; to reach the realm of transcendental objects. The same situation happens when we want to decide on truth or falsity of Continuum Hypothesis ($CH$) or existence of large cardinals. They are independent from our set of axioms ($ZFC$). Set theorists believe on &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; in one of $CH$ or $\neg CH$ based on their personal intuition about the Cantor's heaven. Of course this &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; has an important influence on their mathematical approaches and mathematical life too. Let me to explain more using the following pseudo-logical terminology:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;(Soundness) One should believe on the truth of every provable subject.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;(Smallness) Scientific and mathematical proofs are too few and too short.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;(Largeness) Transcendental subjects and objects are too many and too far from our intuitive set of mathematical and physical axioms.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;(Incompleteness) Most Transcendental subjects and objects (e.g. Large cardinals, Angels, God, etc.) lie beyond borders of scientific and mathematical proofs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;(Faithfulness) The only way to decide on existence of the transcendental objects and subjects is by intuition and faith. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark 6.&lt;/strong&gt; Note that independent mathematical subjects like Continuum Hypothesis and existence of large cardinals are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; meaningless, useless or ignorable. They are just &lt;em&gt;undecidable&lt;/em&gt;. The same situation happens about the other transcendental subjects like angels and God.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, in order to lead your students to spiritual subjects you just need to &lt;em&gt;motivate&lt;/em&gt; them to think about these matters and try to talk about your (and other mathematicians) &lt;em&gt;faiths&lt;/em&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Can I use formal language of mathematics to increase the spirituality of my teaching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Beside their applications, mathematical notations and names could carry implicit meanings. Let me to explain by an example. In set theory we use several names and symbols which have religious meanings too. For example: Hebrew letters, cardinals, absolute, hierarchy, Cantor, etc. Also one can enlarge this list by some funny creative tricks. e.g. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can pronounce the large cardinal symbol $0^{\dagger}$ as &lt;em&gt;zero-cross&lt;/em&gt; not zero-dagger because cross is more peaceful than dagger!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can find a relation between ordinal and &lt;em&gt;ordinance&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can rename &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotomy_%28mathematics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ordinal trichotomy theorem&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;em&gt;trinity&lt;/em&gt; theorem!  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use local notations and names of each field of mathematics effectively. This depends on your creativity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Is there any special spiritual aspect in Linear Algebra?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Use the notion of &lt;em&gt;dimension&lt;/em&gt;. The spiritual beings live in the spiritual worlds. These worlds are &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; than our materialistic universe. What is the meaning of a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; world and a being of a &lt;em&gt;higher type of existence&lt;/em&gt;? In some sense one can interpret it as a world with &lt;em&gt;higher dimensions&lt;/em&gt;. The linear algebra course is the first place which students learn about the notions of space, sub-space and dimension formally. Try to relate these notions to religious concepts. Also you can compare the power of a three dimensional being (like us) in the world of two dimensional creatures (e.g. those who live in a sheet!) with power of a four dimensional being in our three dimensional world. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A human can put his finger somewhere on a sheet. The two dimensional inhabitants of the sheet think some new creature appeared in their world (the two dimensional intersection of finger and sheet). They come to see it! Then the human can withdraw his finger and put it somewhere else on the sheet far from the first place. They see that the strange creature disappeared suddenly and then appeared somewhere else. They may think this creature is traveling in their world like a ghost!  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="230" LastActivityDate="2014-04-01T22:40:03.523" CommentCount="2" />

I think that a carrot/whip for reading some given text is a bad idea, unless your objective &lt;em&gt;really only&lt;/em&gt; is to make them read the text. Those who feel they benefit from reading already do it. Those who don't feel they benefit will either not read, or not get much out of it, and thus get the whip every time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the real reason I'm posting this: Your question raises some counter-questions. I don't mean to sound like I'm picking a fight, and perhaps there are cultural differences here, but some parts of your question seem strange to me.&#xA;(I'm not familiar with the school system in which you're teaching, and I don't know at what level you teach, so bear with me.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Why do you keep using a book that most students do not like? They'll be more likely to read it if they like it...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Is class time spent mostly on you giving lectures? If so, from the students' point of view, I'd expect you to cover at the very least everything needed to pass the course. I might turn to the book to clarify, or to help me remember what you said, or to prime me before your lecture, but I would not expect the book to be the only source of anything essential.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) How old are these kids? If they're somewhat grown up (say 18 yrs old or so), assignments and quizes every time you meet seems like a lot of interference in their learning. People learn in different ways, and the sooner they get to figure out how they learn effectively, the better. Offering a lecture plan, so that those who want to can read ahead and prepare themselves is helpful. Trying to force students to learn in &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; particular way is probably not very effective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, yeah..

Of course not. You are a person and your name is Robert Smith. Now let us get back to my original question: Is 7 a number? Of course not! It is the name of a number. 5 + 2, 6 + 1, and 8 - 1 are names for the same number. The symbol 7 is a numeral for the number.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, your concern extends beyond rational numbers (and is at least a half century old).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today teachers are unlikely to draw such a fine distinction between whether e.g., 1/2 &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a number or &lt;em&gt;represents&lt;/em&gt; a number or is &lt;em&gt;the name of&lt;/em&gt; a number. Instead, they are likely to focus more on whether the students are speaking about the mathematics in a way that makes sense.

Furthermore, 1/2 and 2/4 are the same number even though they are written differently. Nothing like &lt;em&gt;equivalence relations&lt;/em&gt; would be explicitly covered in these classes (I'd write &quot;needless to say,&quot; but people try some wacky stuff).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Implicitly, it helps to talk about a fraction in its simplified form (which is effectively asking for a representative from the infinite equivalence class to which it belongs). This ought to be covered early on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With regard to your title question:&lt;/strong&gt; I would say, e.g., 1/2 &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a number.

The basic setup has been 7 weeks of lectures that I don't have to attend if I don't feel like it, recommended reading (sections so and so in the book) and recommended exercises to solve (nothing to hand in), and then in the 8th week, an exam to determine my grade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many courses have offered the option of doing things during those 7 weeks to gain bonus points for the exam. Maybe hand in some exercises, maybe do some sort of project using the skills taught in the course. This is generally good; those who don't have the time or motivation can ignore it with no ill effects, and the others can do the extra work, retain more knowledge and thus score better on the exam, in addition to the bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few courses have had compulsory activities during the 7 weeks. This has generally been bad. A lot of the students are not used to having deadlines &quot;mid term&quot;, and end up planning poorly, and end up with a lower grade than they'd get if everything was tested in the final exam. Those who plan well end up doing more work for the same knowledge. Some courses really need this though, and for those courses, it's worth the trouble. Examples might be when the course is fairly &quot;hands on&quot;, not very theoretical, and you really need to have the students &quot;do the dirty work&quot; to know what it's like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One course had compulsory assignments to be handed in every 2 weeks, and did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; require the final exam to get a passing grade. This particular course was very much &quot;hands on&quot;; the theoretical content was mostly repetition of earlier courses.

When a course is designed with this in mind, rigor and formalism takes higher precedence as we want as much of the material to be reusable in the context of modules over rings and also multilinear algebra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, even in the world of pure mathematics, linear algebra is fundamental in the development of differential geometry, functional analysis (&quot;infinite dimensional linear algebra&quot;), and differential equations (including dynamical systems, stability analysis, and PDEs). With these applications in mind, it would only make sense to introduce to the students appropriate &lt;em&gt;geometric intuition&lt;/em&gt; behind linear transformations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of pure mathematics, linear algebra is often viewed as synonymous with &quot;stuff having to do with matrices&quot;. For these applications the crucial points of understanding are how to manipulate matrices to facilitate analysis and computation (think PCA and SVD, computationally extracting information from the matrix &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; inverting it). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are somehow able to teach a class addressing all of the above, more the power to you. But the trends that I have been familiar with is to have linear algebra classes designed with different applications in mind: at the very least often times math majors end up taking a different version of the class compare to the engineers and economists. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Going back to your question about cross-products: using a strict definition of linear algebra as the study of linear transformations of vector spaces, then cross products do not belong to linear algebra. It requires necessarily some &lt;em&gt;multilinear&lt;/em&gt; input, be it a quadratic form (an inner product, so we can talk about orthogonality), or a volume form (to convert from two-vectors to one-vector by Hodge dual). On the other hand, these topics may already be covered in a linear algebra class (which usually do not restrict itself to the strict definition anyway), and in this case cross product may be mentioned as an application. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt; if the cross product is mentioned, care must be given to the fact that it behaves &quot;weirdly&quot; under coordinate transformations. (The result of a cross product is a pseudovector.) One of the themes of linear algebra (at least for the first two &quot;thrusts&quot; that I describe) is the possibility of thinking about things in a manner that is coordinate independent (which should certainly be part of any &quot;geometric intuition&quot;). The formula used to compute the cross product, as it is usually taught, is certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; coordinate independent. (I have seen students trying to compute the cross product in a spherical coordinate system.) There are a lot of subtle issues involved that may bring the discussion in conflict with some of the earlier themes of the class, and care must be given to resolve them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I taught linear algebra, I did not talk about the cross product in any great detail (it was not on the centrally-set syllabus; a student brought it up when we talked about computing determinants for 3-by-3 matrices). Looking at the above, it would be hard to fit it into an already tight schedule: to do justice to the subject it will have to be at least one full lecture just on its properties. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect somehow that this is the heart of your problem: many of your students must have seen the cross product before. But the amount of geometry related to the cross product and its properties for a computer graphics course is likely a bit more involved than the cursory discussion the cross product is afforded in any other introductory level mathematics class. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a side remark: the first time I saw cross products was not in a math class at all! This was in a high school &lt;em&gt;physics&lt;/em&gt; class where it naturally came up in the discussion of torque and angular momentum. (Yes, &lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt; high school.) But I wouldn't claim to have a good understanding of the cross product until having studied multilinear algebra and differential geometry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="125" LastActivityDate="2014-04-02T08:48:52.413" CommentCount="4" />

State the multilinear properties of determinant and work through them from as many perspectives as I can: How can we prove them from the formulas?  Why is area multilinear (up to sign)? The area discussion again with a topologically different configuration of vectors, so they can see the signs popping up. If $(u,v,w)$ and $(u,v,w')$ are dependent, why should $(u,v,a w+ a' w')$ be dependent for scalars $a$ and $a'$?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Day Two&lt;/b&gt; Assert that there is a multlinear formula, like determinant, for $n \times n$ matrices. Show how to compute it using row reduction just from multilinearity, and how to take short cuts for upper triangular or block upper triangular matrices. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Day Three&lt;/b&gt; Give the formula in terms of a sum of $n!$ permutations but emphasize that we almost never want to use it for $n&amp;gt;3$. Show that it is multlinear and alternating; don't worry if they don't really follow this. Emphasized that I am only presenting this so that they know determinant exists; they shouldn't think in terms of this formula.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Day Four&lt;/b&gt; Determinants as volume. To some extent, this repeats day 1, but by now they are used to the formulas involved. Talk about why you might want to divide a region into a nonsquare grid and sum to numerically compute an integral, so they need to know volumes of the grid pieces. (Multivariable calc isn't formally a prereq, so I can't do anything deep with multivariate integrals, but a lot of them have it.)  Describe the geometry of the formula $\det (AB) = (\det A)(\det B)$. (I also prepared a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~speyer/417/DetMult.pdf&quot;&gt;handout&lt;/a&gt; with a rigorous proof for those who were interested.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of your list, I never do Cramer's rule or adjugates. They are useful for algebraists (like me!) but their applied use is made obsolete by computers. I spend a lot of time on using multilinearity and on geometric thinking. Cofactor expansion isn't presented as a separate subject, but when I talk about multilinearity, I do examples like:&#xA;$$\det \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp;amp; 8 &amp;amp; 9 \end{pmatrix} = &#xA; \det \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp;amp; 8 &amp;amp; 9 \end{pmatrix} &#xA;+\det \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp;amp; 8 &amp;amp; 9 \end{pmatrix} &#xA;+ \det \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp;amp; 8 &amp;amp; 9 \end{pmatrix} =$$&#xA;$$\det \begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp;amp; 6 \\ 8 &amp;amp; 9 \end{pmatrix} - 2 &#xA;\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp;amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp;amp; 9 \end{pmatrix} +3\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 &amp;amp; 5 \\ 7 &amp;amp; 8 \end{pmatrix} . $$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="51" LastEditorUserId="51" LastEditDate="2014-04-02T17:50:49.367" LastActivityDate="2014-04-02T17:50:49.367" CommentCount="3" />

I see students routinely oversimplifying in the middle of problems---half-way through, they'll do a bunch of work to put an expression into some canonical form, even if it makes the next step in the problem much harder.

But with this  $1/10$ of a bar will go one tenth of&#xA;  a coupon, and if for one coupon we get $1/10$ of a bar of chocolate,&#xA;  for $1/10$ of a coupon we get $1/100$ of a bar of chocolate. To this&#xA;  $1/100$ of a bar of chocolate belongs $1/100$ of a coupon, and for&#xA;  this we again get $1/10$ as much chocolate, i.e.  $1/1000$ of a bar of&#xA;  chocolate, and so on... This process can go infinitely, so that my one&#xA;  bar of chocolate together with its coupon is in fact worth &#xA;  $$1+ 1/10 +1/100 + 1/1000+...$$ bars of chocolate.&#xA;       On the other hand, this is exactly 10/9 of a bar of chocolate. 1 is the value of the actual chocolate and the coupon  that goes with it&#xA;  is 1/9  of a bar of chocolate. Indeed 9 coupons are worth one bar of&#xA;  chocolate because you could ask for such a bar and tell that you will&#xA;  pay after you eat it.

(p.  20).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular problem, Golomb is talking about trominoes that look like extended dominoes.

My thinking is, if you hit them with too much detail while they're skeptical, no matter how good your intentions, you stand a good chance of (effectively) just making an argument from authority.

There are many different ways to express the number, but they are all the same number. This is what we mean by number. Implicit within the concept of number is the assumption of equivalence of fraction. Therefore, when I write $1/2 = 2/4$ I mean to say they are the &lt;strong&gt;same&lt;/strong&gt; number. Or, when I write $0.999\dots =1$ again, I mean to say they are the same number. Are they different expressions? Sure. Do they indicate differing mathematical structures. Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I simply object to making students doubt themselves on questions like &quot;is $1/2$ really $2/4$ ?&quot; There is a time and a place to examine such questions, in my view, that time and place is when you have the tools to properly do such. That is in the context of a course where you are building numbers from the base up. Perhaps a second course in algebra, but certainly not in elementary school. That is a time to build up confidence about how to do things with numbers, not to breed uncertainty about questions which they cannot hope to properly dissect.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is always something foundational to learn. However, I don't think that everything I know now is worthless just because there are gaps in my foundations. I hope that I am aware of the gaps, especially when I task myself on a problem where the gaps have bearing. But, more to the point, it's quite important to be able to do math at different levels of abstraction. Often, it is more important to understand the structure of an object than to be able to give an explicit construction thereof. For example, what is $a+ib$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $i^2=-1$? Is it an extension field of $\mathbb{R}$? Is it the set of $2 \times 2$ matrices $\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a &amp;amp; -b \\ b &amp;amp; a\end{array} \right]$? Is it a pair $(a,b)$ with the multiplication defined in the manner of Gauss? I would offer, for most purposes, the answer that $a+ib$ is the quantity that when multiplied with $c+id$ gives $(a+ib)(c+id) = ac-bd+i(bc+ad)$. Of course, this can be derived from any of the &lt;strong&gt;models&lt;/strong&gt; of complex numbers I mention. Moreover, apart from dispelling a certain air of mystery as to &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; a complex number &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; I don't think it a good use of time in an elementary complex course to belabor the construction. Much better to use them and get to applications and theorems which show the utility and beauty. It is the same with real numbers. Just use them, if you want to discuss their construction, save it for a time when you have tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="128" LastActivityDate="2014-04-03T04:23:42.797" CommentCount="0" />

One can also do some calculations that suggest the development of series. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, given a small number $x$ with $|x|$ much smaller than $1$, approximate $\sqrt{1+x}$ with a linear polyomial $1+px$.  (Pick $x = 1/10$ or $1/100$ for concreteness, and plug in to the results and compare with a calculator value as you go along.)  So we would like to pick $p$ such that $(1+px)^2\approx 1+x$.  If we match coefficients in order from lower to higher degree (i.e., from greater to smaller terms in order of magnitude), we get $p = 1/2$, with the left over term $p x^2$ being the error of the approximation; but $px^2$ will be much smaller than the linear term $2 p x = x$.  Next improve the approximation by adding a quadratic term:&#xA;$$ \left(1 + {1\over2}\,x+q\,x^2 \right)^2 \approx 1+x$$&#xA;Expanding and matching coefficients yields $q = -1/8$.  And so on.  One can see that this can be continued indefinitely.  Is there an easy way to do it?  Does it always get closer?  [Since one probably does not care whether students can carry out these calculations, they could be written out on notes for the students to follow or done on a computer.]  Alternatively, one might do the algebra all at once:  Expanding&#xA;$$ \left(1 + p\,x + q\,x^2 + r\,x^3 + s\,x^4 \right)^2 \approx 1+x$$&#xA;yields&#xA;$$p={{1}\over{2}},\ q=-{{p^2}\over{2}},\ r=-p q,\ s={{1}\over{2}} \left(-2 p r-q^2\right)\,.$$&#xA;The solution can be completed through substitution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example is that the repeated integration from $0$ to $x&amp;gt;0$ of $\sin x \le 1$ or $e^{-x} \le 1$ yields inequalities that show that $\sin x$, $\cos x$, and $e^{-x}$ lie between successive Taylor polynomials. (I would omit the word Taylor in class.)  Since $n!$ grows so fast, you can approximate sine and cosine rather well over the first quadrant.  Again it leads to questions about the indefinite continuation.  This example can be done in Calculus I, if you want to give the students advertisement for Calculus II.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One question that motivates series, not dealing with power series, is the following:  If you could&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BookStackingProblem.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stack as many books&lt;/a&gt; as you wish, how far out over the edge of the book on the bottom could the book at the top extend without the books falling over?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="498" LastEditorUserId="498" LastEditDate="2014-04-12T21:00:40.317" LastActivityDate="2014-04-12T21:00:40.317" CommentCount="1" />

This might seem strange, until one observes that many standard texts which go through several editions often succumb to the natural pressure, amplified by publishers, to become ever-more encyclopedic. The latter has its uses as reference, but perhaps not so much as a guide to the actual threads of a live course. Further, _making_choices_ of what to pay attention to in the course, as opposed to what to ignore (in the course), imparts considerable information to the students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As positive side-effect of omitting some iconic-but-not-immediately-essential things, sometimes there is room to include newer or novel things that otherwise wouldn't find a spot, or happen not to be included in the standard texts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, one's own notes can more accurately support and/or complement one's own lectures and plot-line for a course, so one could argue that picking a standard text and just indicating a subset of it for students could suffice. Even if that is the case, people will see all the other stuff and wonder why you're ignoring it. Intentional, or accidental? Some distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And self-generated notes can be made freely available, and available in electronic formats, and... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to &quot;important considerations&quot;, ... certainly facility with an adequate typesetting software system comes first, or it's hopeless. For a first pass through, don't keep everything in one big file, both because it takes longer to do the inevitable frequent re-typesettings, and because it's hard to find things. Use your computer's file system, etc., to organize things. Keep backups. Some form of &quot;version control&quot; can be useful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About content: especially if you're trying to lighten the burden of encyclopedic texts, don't fall into the (sometimes appealing) trap of &quot;completeness&quot;, or of giving all the iconic examples, or perhaps even working out all details of all proofs of all small things. Instead of contriving artificial exercises, if you've given representative prototypes of relevant arguments, subsequent similar arguments can be left to the reader. Of course, one should be honest with the reader, rather than merely lazy, and be honest with oneself about why something's omitted. (Not to mention competent to confirm that it really is just &quot;more of the same&quot; and routine.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A different sort of point: write at a level and in a style to address the students you actually have, rather than ones you wished you had, or some idealized students. E.g., don't omit arguments or explanations that you know perfectly well most of your students couldn't fill in, don't couch things in terms you know are more sophisticated than your audience, ... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming to some questions of taste: the pressures for traditionally published texts to be fairly formal are not entirely helpful to students or mathematics. That is, there is stylistic pressure to be &lt;em&gt;formal&lt;/em&gt;, and to follow a certain (quite recent, modern!) style of definition-lemma-proof-lemma-...-theorem-proof... exercises. Candidly, one often discovers that the exercises are cryptic exhibition of the formative examples that motivated the whole business, but the natural causal sequence has been &lt;em&gt;inverted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, yes, a certain amount of that inversion can be &lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt;, clarifying, but the standard full-blown version is not. (To name-drop) Gelfand was a consistent advocate of giving the key examples so that &quot;definitions and theorems and proofs&quot; become almost afterthoughts. E.g., definitions should be &quot;justified&quot; by examples...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Especially in fairly sophisticated mathematics, terminology is heavy, usage is inconsistent or slightly abused, etc., and trying to &quot;repair&quot; the situation by cranking up the formality is attractive, but often doomed or at least incredibly expensive. Instead, giving the watershed examples, rather than trying to make &quot;rules&quot; or rigidify language, seems to me to more directly address the genuine issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And be prepared to defend (on scientific and pedagogical grounds) any deviation from the iconic sources, because it seems that people are quite happy to believe in the authority of iconic authors' writings. Many people in the math business do seem to believe that definitions given in iconic texts are &quot;sacred&quot;, too, and are beyond discussion, so don't be surprised when people are inflexible in this regard!

Different symbols, which indicate the same abstract quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are two meanings of representation that we have to distill.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Definition of representation (as you mean it):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The symbol that identifies something (&quot;2&quot;, &quot;0.5&quot;, &quot;pi&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; that identifies something.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself is &quot;1/2&quot; actually a symbol like &quot;2&quot;?

Think about it, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;1/2&quot; is actually a combination of 3 distinct &lt;em&gt;symbols&lt;/em&gt; that when combined have inherent meaning as to a process. That process is mathematical division.&lt;/strong&gt; It is literally &quot;1 divided by 2.&quot; From this thought process I would conclude that &quot;1/2&quot; is &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; the number, but a representation (&lt;em&gt;definition #2&lt;/em&gt;) of it. This is distinctly different than looking at &quot;0.5&quot;, this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the symbol that identifies that value (there is no &lt;em&gt;procedure&lt;/em&gt; to this representation).

Make sure to generalizing from geometric vectors to non-normalized eigenfunctions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Projecting vectors onto non-orthogonal bases. This requires calculating reciprocal vectors. This is useful in solid-state, as well as special and general relativity. It also encourages students to make up coordinate systems, like ellipsoidal coordinates z=a r cos q, x=b r sin q cos f, y=c r sin q sin f.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;calculating the principal moments and principal axes of the moment of inertia.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;calculating the (eigen)modes and modal frequencies of vibrating systems.

Demonstrating this with a system of 3 or so masses isn't THAT hard, and is very cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Schrödinger Equation steady state:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This equation is so fundamental to physics that it can really drive home how ridiculously important linear algebra is to Physicists.  Unfortunately, describing what the wave function represents can be difficult.  The best way is to describe the square of the wave function as a probability distribution.  Thankfully as well, the steady state problem is real, and you don't have to deal with complex numbers. We can write down the Schrödinger equation as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$ {\cal H}\Psi(t) = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \boldsymbol{\nabla} + V(\mathbf{x}) \right) \Psi(t) = -i \hbar \partial_t \Psi(t)$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From here, we can choose a basis by separating out the time dependence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$ \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \boldsymbol{\nabla} + V(\mathbf{x}) \right) \Psi_e = e \Psi_e $&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then we can write:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$ {\cal H}\Psi_e = e \Psi_e $&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where ${\cal H}$ is the finite difference expression of $\Psi$ on a grid.  For example, for the 1D problem with a simple harmonic oscillator:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$ {\cal H}\Psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m h^2} \left(\Psi(x_{i-1}) - 2\Psi(x_{i} + \Psi(x_{i+1}) \right) + \frac{k}{2} x_i^2 \Psi(x_{i}) $&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where $i$ is an index on the evenly spaced discretized grid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (unfortunately, for anything on a reasonable grid, this requires too many points to do by hand).  These eigenvalues describe the steady state energies of the system!  And the eigenvectors describe the steady state wave functions!  Interestingly enough, this particular problem describes vibrational levels in molecules remarkably well (especially for the lowest energy states).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="621" LastEditorUserId="621" LastEditDate="2014-04-03T22:36:45.020" LastActivityDate="2014-04-03T22:36:45.020" CommentCount="1" />

It is easy to fill your time with writing lecture notes but that isn't always the best use of that time.  Nevertheless, it can be useful for the students so here are my tips.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you'll be teaching the course several times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's likely that the notes won't come together until after the end of the course, so you should be thinking a bit that you're writing to help the next lot of students.  To ensure that this isn't unnecessary work, make sure that the next lot of students are your students as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write as you go along.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can never plan everything from the start, particularly at the detail needed for notes.  Writing as you go along means that you are writing it knowing what the current lot of students need, so your efforts will be concentrated on where they are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's tempting to write as much as possible, but as others have already said this is a temptation to be resisted.  Write what the students need right now.  If you get a moment to add more later, fine, but don't let that be your top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there are textbooks around, but they aren't really usable as a book for this course, think about how to make your notes be the bridge between the course and the book rather than replacing the book.  Even a simple glossary can be of immense value, or a &quot;look up list&quot; of where students can find particular topics (useful if the book is rather large compared to what you're teaching).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a wiki.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a practical tip.  Write your notes on a wiki (preferably a mathematically-enabled one).  The advantages of this are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologically, it's easier to write a short, incomplete wiki page than a, say, PDF document.  So writing on a wiki means that you get a little bit up quickly and then gradually improve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperlinking your notes is an immense added value.  Just imagine a theorem in which all the key terms are hyperlinked to their definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student's can fix typos themselves instead of continually barraging you with emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notes no longer need to be linear.  You can add optional extras, such as a page where you go into greater detail for those interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the motivation for writing your own notes in a course where textbooks are available?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote notes for a course which was a &quot;cut and shut&quot; course.  When I took it over, it used three textbooks (one only a chapter) and only one of those was actually any good.  Although I found better replacements, I still felt unhappy about asking students to buy three textbooks for one course (as partial mitigation, I found free online textbooks for some parts).  Also, things didn't go smoothly between the books.  So I wrote supplemental notes to help bridge the gap between the lectures and the books, and in some places to replace the books altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can find my notes online on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathsnotes.math.ntnu.no/mathsnotes/show/TMA4145+Home+Page&quot;&gt;my course wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="112" LastActivityDate="2014-04-04T07:21:25.270" CommentCount="5" />

Both College Algebra and Calculus more or less introduced me to all this stuff that &quot;works by fiat.&quot;  Well, Discrete Math/Combinatorics taught me &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; algebra works. (Not all the way of course, but it felt far less like magic!)  Calculus still appears to be magic to me.  It isn't enough for me to know that smart people proved it works... so analysis it is!  After I climb this mountain I know there will be other peaks but for now I'll limit myself to just understanding how calculus works.  I will likely study Abstract Algebra after this so I can deeply understand hyperelliptic curves.

When I was something like 2-3 years old my Dad taught me to add and subtract single digit numbers by sawing (and sanding for safety) pieces of wood of dimensions about half an inch x $2$ inches x $2n$ inches, where $n$ is the integer to be presented. He also drew the digit in the middle in red ink. The idea was then to add, say $2+3$, by juxtaposing the sticks representing $2$ and $3$ and then compare the total length to that of longer sticks and find the one that matches. He also defined $a-b$ as a solution of the equation $b+x=a$ that can similarly be solved by finding the stick that fits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A generation later I repeated the exercise. It worked to my satisfaction and to my son's amusement. When my son started school (in Finland first graders are aged 7) his teacher asked parents for ideas for an &quot;evening at school&quot;. So I did this number again. The kids picked it up immediately, and while they were excited for the allotted 5 minutes or so, it was apparent that it was too easy for them. The teacher was observing me with a group of kids, and he suggested afterwards that a 7-year-old's cognitive ability has, indeed, developed enough to deal with the quantity concept more abstractly, and this was thus trivial. He did think that this model is beneficial for pre-schoolers.

Second, as noted, as much as anything people rationalize their own limitations or failings by blaming something external. And identifying an &quot;other&quot; and vilifying it has a long tradition in human history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could explain to the students that the definition-lemma-proof-theorem-proof picture is usually created with much &lt;em&gt;hindsight&lt;/em&gt;, after many bouts of experiment, heuristics, revision. So our modern definition often came &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; in real life, while the desired/needed proto-theorem was presented to us by exterior circumstances. That is, &quot;axiomatic mathematics&quot; is most often done &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; a long period of experiment and revision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, some parts of school-math present only the end-product, but it would promote a methodological error to allow people to take a &quot;Whiggish&quot; view of these developments. That is, it's not that pre-axiomatic ideas were foolish or became irrelevant or obsolete. Rather, they constitute the phenomena-of-interest that were later organized by axiomatization. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Terry Tao &lt;a href=&quot;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/there%E2%80%99s-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/&quot;&gt;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/there%E2%80%99s-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/&lt;/a&gt; and others, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://m-phi.blogspot.com/2013/03/terry-tao-on-rigor-in-mathematics.html&quot;&gt;http://m-phi.blogspot.com/2013/03/terry-tao-on-rigor-in-mathematics.html&lt;/a&gt; have reasonably labelled developmental stages of mathematical thinking as pre-rigorous, rigorous, and &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; -rigorous, in application to individuals. This has observable substance in application to individuals, but application to the larger enterprise is less clear.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we can point out to our students that few of the historically well-known mathematicians made a distinction between &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;applied&quot;, nor did they artificially confine themselves either in action or self-labelling. Most of the really interesting developments in mathematics arguably help us understand both very literal objects as well as idealized objects, and the whole range between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And there is also the caution that some of the mid-to-late 20th century sense of &quot;applied math&quot; really meant numerical solution of PDEs, whether truly directly &quot;applied&quot; to create marketable products and local jobs or not. It may be that the WWII and study of non-linear waves to make big bombs leant special gravitas to numerical solution of PDE.

Of these, I think (c) may be particularly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, in 1999-2000, MIT professor &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/lewin_walter.html&quot;&gt;Walter Lewin&lt;/a&gt; taught a  two-semester introductory physics course.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01-physics-i-classical-mechanics-fall-1999/video-lectures/&quot;&gt;Videos of this course&lt;/a&gt; were placed online, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeXIV-wMVUk&quot;&gt;some of which&lt;/a&gt; have garnered almost 2 million views on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His goal for the course was to teach &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; introductory physics course.  According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/education/19physics.html&quot;&gt;this New York Times article&lt;/a&gt;, he prepared almost 25 hours for each lecture, which means 50 hours of preparation for two lectures a week.  In addition to preparing marvelous experimental demonstrations, he also prepared nearly word-for-word exactly what he would say during each lecture, and then memorized this &quot;script&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What this means is that he taught only one four-credit course each semester, and he worked more than full time on this.  How does this compare to the workload of the typical high-school teacher?  Or of a typical professor?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My impression is that most good teachers put &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; work into their classes than is absolutely required, in an effort to help the students learn.  For example, sometimes when I teach I write up extensive lecture notes for the students, even though they already have the lecture as well as the textbook.  These notes seem to help the students quite a bit, but writing up such notes isn't exactly required of me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know this is true at the high school level as well.  My mother was a high-school Spanish teacher for many years, and she would regularly put quite a lot of effort into preparing interesting and fun activities for the students that would introduce them to aspects of the Spanish and Mexican cultures.  I don't think this was required of her, but she did it because she was fulfilling &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; interpretation of what it means to be a good teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my conclusion is that &quot;workload&quot; isn't exactly a relevant concept for teachers.  Most teachers choose for themselves how much work to do, based on their own personal standards for what constitutes good teaching.  The more classes you have to teach, the less time you will have for each, and so the less well you will do your job.  But I'm not sure there's any objective way to compare the workloads of different kinds of teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; All that being said, I do agree with the spirit of the question.

I'll address mathematics, since most of my experience lies there, but I suspect similar observations apply to computer science (which I've also paid some attention to since late 1960s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, beyond the obvious connection to immediate tactile reality, mathematics allows &quot;precocity&quot; and forms of &quot;problem-solving&quot; that do not necessarily depend heavily on wider experience, in contrast to, for example, history or philosophy. And timed low-level problem-solving contests, in which speed plays a key role? Nothing like that in much else. Even music performance, which can be very much &quot;of the moment&quot; and allowing precocity, is not just about playing as many notes as possible. The &quot;problem&quot; is that subsequent development of mathematics in school or in real life &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; depend more and more on wider experience (even if only somewhat interior to mathematics), and considerably less on raw quickness or cleverness. The sense of pace changes enormously. Kids may reasonably see this as a bait-and-switch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The typical school curriculum (what I've seen in the U.S.) and ambient cultural attitudes (manifest in the curriculum) reinforce a peculiarly shallow picture of what mathematics is, and what it means to excell at it. Contests are understandable, but more substantive things aren't. Use of low-level math (&quot;(pre) calculus&quot;?) to &quot;filter&quot; for other life paths, is rather strange, but accounts for the size of the math departments in U.S. public universities. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular, kids can be declared &quot;successes&quot; in mathematics already at a strangely young age, based on criteria that mislead them, thus selecting for traits that are not ... in fact ... best longer-term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there'd not really be anything good accomplished by eliminating contests, for example. The fact that this aspect is easily and popularly misinterpreted seems to me inescapable. There should be a strong counterpoint to this attitude, but our school system itself traditionally rewards similar traits, so...?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a further, complementary problem, in my observation, that (in the U.S., anyway) &quot;the system&quot; often selects &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; mathematical traits that would in fact be beneficial long-term, in cases where the quick-clever-contest-math attributes are not strongly present. It's so easy to over-simplify, and identify quickness with talent, that even in math grad school lack of facility in timed exams is misconstrued as lack of mathematical talent. I confess that it took me a long time to recover from this misunderstanding, myself, and I have no good recommendation about over-coming either side of this false identification, except to keep it in mind and remind others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="63" LastActivityDate="2014-04-05T18:13:25.097" CommentCount="3" />

The discussion must be accessible to students undergoing their first rigorous course in analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The discussion is well-motivated: the authors point out in §7.1 that one can integrate all functions of the form $x^r$ for all rational $r \neq 1$ in terms of functions of the same kind. So to integrate $x \mapsto 1/x$, they introduce the logarithm function and study its properties. Now, of course, one has to verify that this is a genuinely new function: they show that $x \mapsto \ln(x), x &amp;gt; 0$ is not a rational function (cf. Lemma 7.26, loc. cit.): in fact, it is not even an algebraic function (cf. Proposition 7.27, loc. cit.). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the next natural question is integrating inverses of quadratic polynomials. If the polynomial factors into (necessarily) linear factors, one might use partial fractions. However, if the polynomial does not factor over $\mathbf{C}$, then, we are stuck again! One may show using the method of partial fraction that it suffices to learn to integrate the function $x \mapsto 1/(1+x^2)$. They then introduce the arctangent function as the integral of $1/(1+x^2)$ and go on to prove its familiar properties. The other trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions are defined from just this function (by algebraic formulas or by using the monotonicity to establish the existence of an inverse, as applicable). Once again, the authors prove that the trigonometric functions are transcendental (cf. Proposition 7.29, loc. cit.). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me reproduce the following quote from the linked book:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The approach outlined above gives not only a precise definition of the logarithmic, exponential and the trigonometric functions, but also a genuine motivation for introducing the same. In most texts on calculus, the trigonometric functions are ‘defined’ by drawing triangles and mentioning that angles are ‘measured’ in radians. The main problem with this approach is succinctly described by Hardy [...], who writes: “The whole difficulty lies in the question, what is the x which occurs in cos x and sin x.” Hardy also describes different methods to develop an analytic theory (cf. [...]) and the approach we have chosen is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would like to point out that this method is very similar to how we introduce the number systems to students (by showing them equations &quot;in those systems&quot; you cannot solve by staying there!). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The authors also point out: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Failure to be able to integrate a function has often led to interesting developments in mathematics. For example, a rich and fascinating theory of the so-called elliptic integrals and elliptic functions arises in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="109" LastActivityDate="2014-04-05T23:33:53.580" CommentCount="3" />

Mark two of them blue. The blue area is $\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{3}{4}$ &lt;strong&gt;of&lt;/strong&gt; the rectangle. If you ignore the red part, you can see, that it's also $\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$ of the rectangle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Variant 2: Divide each of the quarters into three equal parts. How many small parts is the rectangle composed of? It's $3\cdot 4=12$, so we're talking twelths here. In each of the red quarters, mark two of the three parts blue. How many are those? It's $3\cdot 2=6$. So, what's the blue share of the full rectangle? It's $\frac{6}{12}=\frac{1}{2}$. That's the same as variant 1, so our thinking was right.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you write the numbers in different colors, you can show the students by this generalizable example, that $\frac{a}{b}\cdot\frac{c}{d}=\frac{a\cdot c}{b\cdot d}$ and that they can cancel out the 3s as they are not needed in the end of each variant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this should be &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_%28psychological_school%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;constructed&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Division&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to multiplication, we work formally here, revisiting the technique of inverse operations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example: $\frac{5}{7}:\frac{2}{3}=\frac{a}{b}$ and we want to know, what $a$ and $b$ are. The inverse operation to division is multiplication. $\frac{a}{b}$ is the fraction, for which $\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{a}{b}=\frac{5}{7}$. We know now, that then $2\cdot a$ must be $5$ and $3\cdot b$ must be 7, but that's not possible for integers $a$ and $b$. But expanding the fraction is our friend here. We just expand $\frac{5}{7}$ by $2$ and by $3$, then it's no problem anymore to find integers $a$ and $b$:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{a}{b}=\frac{5}{7}=\frac{5\cdot 2}{7\cdot 2}=\frac{5\cdot 2\cdot 3}{7\cdot 2\cdot 3}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now we have $2\cdot a =5\cdot 2\cdot 3$, which means $a=5\cdot 3$, and $3\cdot b=7\cdot 2\cdot 3$, which means $b=7\cdot 2$.

I recognize all students who range in math skills, ability and disposition towards the subject and offer accommodations for all. For example, I had 2 high students in my previous algebra 1 classes whom demonstrate very low skills and math comprehension. I provided accomodations for these students: extended office hours, extended time on assessments, typed or printed notes, visual aids, graphic organizers, and partner seating arrangement with students who can assist them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On my whiteboard, the standards, objectives, agenda with the use of formative (five finger check for understanding, thumbs up/thumbs down understanding/class discussion) and summative assessments (ticket out, quiz, test etc.) is written on the board for students to see and how they will be engaged therefore minimizing level of distraction for students which could really help with behavior problems. My agenga is usually a warm up, warm up debrief, homework review, collaborative activity, and ticket-out assessment. At the end of the week, if I feel (from ticket outs) that students are ready for a quiz, I will give a quiz.  For grading, I usually only grade ticket outs. Their classwork/homework is collected but I only grade certain problems - sometimes (because there's 150 students) I have them exchange papers and grade it for me. Also, a lot of collaborative assignments are given therefore minimizing my grading. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A high school teacher must also be aware of pre-requisite knowledge and students misconceptions with respect to the standards discussed. A high school teacher must also include in his lesson plan how he will address the needs of subgroups and individual students such as English Language Learners, students with Learning Disabilities, and Gifted students.  An example of all the aforementioned is here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/xv1Gz.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College Instructor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my &quot;easy&quot; job. Similar to high school. No behavior issues therefore classroom management is more laid back. No parent conferences. No calls home etc. More teacher centered than that of high school (which is both teacher centered, student centered, one on one instruction, and direct instruction). We have Audial, Visual, and Kinesthetic learners here too so we must still use a combination of teacher and student centered approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I establish rapport with students first day of class (student survey), communicate my expectation/procedures, and I motivate students to learn. But since time is an issue and you can't really give 'classwork', I have to really keep my instruction mostly doing explicit instruction 80%. Here's my lesson plan for college instruction:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Warmup Lecture (Performing an instruction strategy &quot;I do, we do, you do&quot;)&#xA;2)Lecture&#xA;3) Guided Practice&#xA;4) Lecture&#xA;5) Guided Practice&#xA;6) Ticket out (to inform me of whether students were learning what I put on the board - this is important because the following lecture I will outline any student misconceptions on my warmup)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All homework assignments are on their syllabus. They turn in all homework last day of lecture for that week. A test is given for every 2 chapters with the ability to make them up if they didn't pass.

Namely, it's not that intuition-per-say is misleading, but that &lt;em&gt;untrained&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;inexperienced&lt;/em&gt; intuition is... untrained and inexperienced. &lt;em&gt;Of&lt;/em&gt; _course_ many reasonable, normal things (in this complicated world) will be surprises to a naif.

To tell people to &lt;em&gt;distrust&lt;/em&gt; their in tuition I think is a very bad thing, especially insofar as it tells them that they should, in effect, accept &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; from a sufficient authority, without much questioning. When this becomes suspension of critical faculties, it is obviously methodologically disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would also disagree with the examples of naive set theory and so on. &lt;em&gt;Mostly&lt;/em&gt; naive set theory is perfectly fine in practice, in applications to mathematics. The fact that it can be over-revved, pushed beyond safe limits, should not be construed as counter-intuitive. Yes, it is interesting to see how to axiomatize (=set rules) to avoid seeming paradox... but I note that it is very difficult to arrange rules sufficiently encompassing so as to prevent all stupid choices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the real point is that intuition is not static. It is &lt;em&gt;trained&lt;/em&gt;, not innate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I think that it's not exactly &quot;definitions&quot; (or axioms, nearly the same thing) that train intuition at a most fundamental level, but &lt;em&gt;examples&lt;/em&gt;, especially the examples that show both the good side, and the bad side, of issues eventually iconified into definitions or axioms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the historical fact that almost universally examples have preceded &quot;definitions&quot;, and that definitions tend to have more explanatory power than do definitions (which always leave me immediately asking myself what situation the dang definition was trying to avoid or get into... why not just tell me directly, instead of being coy?), I strongly feel that definitions are in effect a &lt;em&gt;summary&lt;/em&gt; of important examples, and make scarce sense and should not be given prior to examples... and, by that point (as I am fond of saying) the formal definitions, the main theorems (which were what we wanted all along, if only we admitted it up front) and their proofs (illustrated more simply in examples) should be almost entirely clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="63" LastActivityDate="2014-04-06T22:27:22.500" CommentCount="3" />

An important outcome in this case is not to assume that you have &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; intuition, but instead to think about how you can make the end result sync up better with what could be reasonably guessed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Borrowing terms from (Piagetian) developmental psychology, the (unpleasant) experience of acquiring new information that does not accord with one's existing cognitive schemas is known as disequilibrium; the process of updating one's schematic understanding so as to fit in this new information more naturally is known as equilibration, and this is when &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allow me to give a &lt;strong&gt;concrete example:&lt;/strong&gt; Ask secondary school students to use their intuition to guess the percentage of entries in a $10 \times 10$ multiplication table that are odd. In all likelihood, they will guess $50\%$; this is probably based on some intuition around numbers alternating between odd and even.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the actual answer is $25\%$. Why? A proof is that a product of two numbers is odd iff both numbers are odd; in this case, we have five choices for odd numbers ($1, 3, 5, 7, 9$) and so a total of $25$ out of the $100$ entries will be odd. With regard to intuition, one might note that taking products can introduce new factors, and a number is only odd if you never get a factor of $2$; this is tough. Alternatively, one might note that among the four cases even*even, even*odd, odd*even, and odd*odd, only $1$ of the $4$ gives an odd number; so seeing $1/4 = 25\%$ feels right &lt;em&gt;intuitively&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At a higher level, suppose you are a teacher thinking about other nonstandard problems to pose with the multiplication table. How many distinct entries are there in an $n \times n$ table? This question looks pretty reasonable, and one can quickly guess how to start it: check small values of $n$. But now step back and use your (Number Theoretical) intuition: the multiplication table is a way of encoding composite numbers and prime numbers (e.g., a number $p$ is prime iff it appears exactly twice in an &quot;extended&quot; multiplication table). By updating one's intuition to conceive of the table as being related to primality, it comes as less of a surprise that this question is far too difficult for a secondary school student. (In fact, what we have here is the Erdos multiplication table problem; it is quite hard: &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/a/108939/22971&quot;&gt;MathOverflow link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for distinguishing between different areas of mathematics by using intuition as a lens, I do not think this is a fruitful approach. It may be that some people are primed to have certain ways of thinking, or &lt;em&gt;modalities of thought&lt;/em&gt;, cf. Facet 4 in the following reference:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Gruber, H. E., &amp;amp; Wallace, D. B. (1999). The case study method and evolving systems approach for understanding unique creative people at work. &lt;em&gt;Handbook of creativity, 93&lt;/em&gt;, 115.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes one's way of thinking differing from the general trend in an area of mathematics can lead to a breakthrough. For a concrete example, consider that Paul Cohen managed to prove the independence of the Continuum Hypothesis (from ZFC) with a line of thought (related to &quot;decision procedures&quot;) that directly contradicted Godel's work. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/a/160508/22971&quot;&gt;MathOverflow link&lt;/a&gt;.) In the end, it was not Cohen's set theoretical intuition that allowed him to tackle Hilbert's first problem, but rather intuition developed elsewhere. That said, other Mathematical Logicians and Set Theorists, once they equilibrated in response to Cohen's work, were quickly able to push forward the notions introduce by Cohen. For more on this history, see:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Kanamori, A. (2008). Cohen and set theory. &lt;em&gt;The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic&lt;/em&gt;, 351-378.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, we have advances in set theory due both to those with mathematical intuition from elsewhere, as well as due to those with mathematical intuition specifically from set theory and mathematical logic.

Various mathematical objects are models of various aspects of our universe. $\mathbb R^3$ is typically taken as a model of three-dimensional space. But, it is only a model. Some things that are true in the model are false in space and some that are false in the model are true in space (just like any good model, it is not a precise replica of the thing being modeled, it distorts some things, neglects others, all so that it simplifies the original thing so that it is amenable to be studied by formal means). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Banach-Tarski paradox is an illustration of (one of) the limitations of $\mathbb R^3$ as a model of the familiar (yet bizarre) ambient space we live in. There are plenty other such incompatibilities. For instance, perfect circles exist in $\mathbb R^3$, you may want to invite your student to construct one in real life. Physics seems to prohibit that just as much it prohibits doubling lumps of gold just by rearranging them piece-wise. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To conclude, models are models. If a model predicts something about whatever it models, then that prediction should be understood within the limitations and distortions made during the modeling process. An incompatibility between the model and reality may entail lots of things. Perhaps a need to abandon the model or a need to adjust it. But sometimes it should just be put away, stored on the shelf of those odd little things that the simplifications assumptions we made bring forth. To your students (or mine, as I often give this example in a first year calculus course), I would say: go ahead and decide how to categorize the Banach-Tarski paradox: is it a serious flaw in the model, a minor disagreement with reality, or an oddity.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastActivityDate="2014-04-07T00:49:14.897" CommentCount="1" />

One demands an accurate description of applied mathematics, the other can be answered in terms of one's aspirations or perception of value, and that distinction can be explained if it's unclear or not acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Motivation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deep theorems often come from intuitions. Intuitions have to come from somewhere. Sometimes you get them from working elementary examples' features into your brain, but this can be near-sighted. Instead, they often come from an appeal to a natural connection between two subjects, and the overdetermining of properties induced by the multiple sets of semantics - every group is a permutation group, for example, is a formalization of the intuition about groups being transformers as well as algebras. The Sylow theorems and several properties of interest are capturing periodicity and self-similarity decompositions of group structure arising from viewing them as or expecting them to be the collections of symmetries of an object. Applied mathematics functions always in a context, and cross-pollination of semantics is an inherent part of such naturalistic environments. As such, it's an important source of intuition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Projective geometry, for instance, arose from applied mathematics and the intuition it brought, and its importance in the structure of abstract objects (algebraic geometry, projective representations, manifolds, homology, hyperbolic geometry, continued fractions, the modular group) is worth the thinking it takes to justify without any trace of solipsism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Applied mathematics can lead to these new fields because it poses problems that wouldn't be considered problems or be thought up by someone working only off their existing knowledge. It can also pose problems that are unmanageably difficult, which in mathematics suggests there are underlying paradigms left to be uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a modern example, crack analysis can now be done using fractal measures and other abstract ways of reasoning, except when it comes to intersections of propagating cracks, these theories tend to break down abruptly and the finite-element method must be used to proceed with the description of the cracks approximately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also one of the best ways to motivate a special case, informing the specific calculations that will allow one to become adept at a field. Most (classes of) differential equations are posed as tasks for their representation of a physically observed behavior, and in that way arbitrary calculations obtain a life of their own through application. So, for a pure mathematician - and by that I mean one which isn't strictly concerned with real-world tasks, applied contexts are rich interfaces to mathematics. Knowing any field in such detail helps gauge your depth of knowledge in other fields, and an application will evade giving a sense of security until that point is reached and the motivating problems have been solved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All mathematics is descriptive of something, so how is non-applied mathematics to be intrinsically distinct from applied mathematics? It might be they disagree with having a non-mathematical goal, or have the impression that someone primarily does applied mathematics when mathematical goals aren't inherently valuable to them. It might be because educators often treat students as if mathematics is opaque to them whenever it isn't shrouded in a real-world scenario. These are cultural reactions. Perhaps their problem is actually with the experience they expect of applied mathematics, or the type of output they expect to be giving. The diagnostic should come before the prescription. Much of what people are trying to avoid by professing these alignments can be a problem in pure mathematics, in a generalized form, and if you have the wrong reasons to avoid something you narrow your tools for gaining experience and proficiency in a field in which you're mostly left to your own devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="727" LastActivityDate="2014-04-07T08:57:03.153" CommentCount="0" />

In a large lecture hall, you can use individual student response devices so that every student votes on their answer to the question, and you get to see the distribution of responses. This allows you to make your decision about how to proceed with the lesson plan based on data, rather than just your intuition about what they understand. Sometimes people are bored and do not ask questions because there is nothing new in what is being presented.

So I'd like to state it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key is to decide what your homework is for.  The big words are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formative_assessment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summative_assessment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In short, &lt;em&gt;formative&lt;/em&gt; assessment is designed to help you learn, &lt;em&gt;summative&lt;/em&gt; assessment is designed to figure out what you've learnt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The distinction is not clear cut, and I'm no expert so I won't pretend to be.  In truth, all assessment is a mixture since unless we know what we have learnt, how can we figure out how to learn it better?  And if we don't use the assessment of what we've learnt to find out more, what was the point in measuring it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we can broadly assign assessment to one of the two classes by its primary use.  I suspect that the majority opinion would be that homeworks are for &lt;em&gt;formative&lt;/em&gt; assessment.  We only grade them to encourage students to do them, reasoning that if we don't give the students credit for doing them then they won't choose to do so of their own free will (but note quid's comment on the question!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this sends out the wrong message.  By counting them as part of the final grade, the students view the homeworks as &lt;em&gt;summative&lt;/em&gt;: a measure of what they have learnt, and therefore view them as something to achieve rather than as something to reflect upon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also unfortunately, the default assumption on students' part seems to be that all assessment is summative.  This is because the majority are not aware of these nuances, and are more aware of the occasions where they have undergone summative assessment rather than formative (the latter being, by its nature, less stressful and more subtle, and so less noticeable).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore it is not enough to simply say &quot;Do the homework for your own good&quot;.  You will need to set up a culture of reflection.  Here are some broad guidelines.  Again, I'm not an expert and have not implemented (all of) these myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you must include a homework part in the overall assessment, make the bar as low as possible.  Essentially, if they try the homework they should get the credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use feedback from the homeworks in your teaching.  Use the homeworks to find out what people found difficult and then go over that again in class time.  Make it so that the students see the link between the information that they give you through the homeworks and the help that they get afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my course, the rule is that they need 8 out of 12 homeworks &quot;approved&quot; to be able to take the final exam.

My current job is Associate Professor of Mathematics Education in an education department, but I do teach mathematics courses (mathematics content for elementary teachers) as a part of my job.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The workload itself is very different in general. As a junior high mathematics teacher, I taught 5 sections a year (two sections of one course and three sections of another course), and each course had about 30 students in it. I also had other roles, such as teacher duties (lunch duty, detention duty) and coaching (or advising student groups) responsibilities. I had one preparation period each day for which I had to complete all grading, planning, copying, etc. And of course that meant I took a lot of work home. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a college professor at a research institution, I teach two or fewer classes each semester (depending on whether a research grant has bought me out of teaching a course), with no more than 35 students in each class, probably less. But I have more administrative duties now as a professor, and the research expectation is large enough to take up a non-trivial portion of my time. Plus, there is a great deal of one-on-one teaching while working with graduate students -- advising them on dissertation work, etc. So the general nature of the work is tough to compare. Both roles require a lot of time beyond a standard 40 hour work week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have never felt more physically exhausted than when I was a junior high teacher. I have never felt more mentally drained than in my current job. Both kinds of draining also have unique feelings of invigoration associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To those who have been employed in both secondary and college education, is there a level of college teaching that feels similar to high-school teaching (i.e. is teaching high school similar to teaching 4 college classes a semester)? If college education is too dissimilar to compare to high school/middle school, what are the key differences that set them apart?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ah, so the real question is to compare the work of teaching, then?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Preparing to teach feels similar now, although I think I am better at it just because more time has passed -- I have learned more about how to target my teaching to connect to my students' thinking, how to create lessons that support conceptual understanding in balance with procedural fluency. But I'd like to think I would have gotten better at this and learned more regardless of my role. So, planning to teach might be similar if we compare class to class and assume equal time was available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The act of delivering a lesson -- assume the same number of students in each class (which is a big assumption in some cases) -- and one major difference is probably obvious: classroom management. K-12 education in the USA is compulsory up until age 16, right? And college students have more of a choice of whether or not to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But also teachers still must motivate and engage learners at every level, because all students can choose to check out mentally (either choosing not to physically show up in college or not mentally be there in secondary school).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also agree with the person above who said no parent calls or contact. I would do this as a middle school teacher. I am literally not allowed to discuss student progress with a parent at the university level, because the student is a legal adult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not agree that college teaching has to be more teacher-centered. I think that college teaching can build upon students' thinking, be interactive, and be tailored to the individual needs of students -- particularly if the class is smaller in size -- but college instructors are not required to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I collaborate more with colleagues on planning and debriefing from instruction and also I conduct research on my undergraduate students' learning now as a college professor. But I would have liked to collaborate like this and to conduct action research as a teacher. I didn't have time as a newer teacher, and none of us in my department made this kind of work a priority then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do probably spend more time planning and grading as a professor than I did as a teacher, but perhaps because I have more time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Class-to-class, I probably spend more time on teaching two classes now than I did when teaching two classes as a junior high teacher. But I had more students and more classes when I taught junior high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a college professor, we are not evaluated by our students' test scores. Our raises are not affected by student performance (although perhaps the administration could take students' performance into account a bit more?). Instead, I am evaluated by student evaluations and my reflections on my own teaching. I ramp this up by conducting publishable research related to my students' learning, however, so I am able to present data to administrators that takes students' learning into account, as least for some of my courses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is how a typical lesson of mine went as a junior high teacher: Students came in and work on a warm up problem or two. We discussed that problem. We went over the previous night's homework. I presented some material, they practiced some problems with some guidance from me, we discussed the problems -- including some students coming to the board to share their work and thinking, then the students had time to work independently on the problems to get started on their homework during class. Sometimes (once a week or every two weeks), we had a more exploratory problem solving lesson involving working together in groups using manipulatives to understand concepts and develop mathematical understandings on more challenging tasks that required working together in groups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is how a typical lesson of mine (for my mathematics courses for prospective teachers) goes as a college professor: Students come in and sit in their groups and start sharing their homework solutions with each other. We spend time at the beginning of the class going over homework -- mostly with the undergrads coming up to the document camera explaining their thinking and talking with each other about the mathematics. I am more of a facilitator during the going-over-homework process than I used to be. Then, I give them a task that is within their zones of proximal development (they have enough prior knowledge to get started, but they are learning new mathematics by working on the task) to solve with their groups. After they work for a while, we have a class discussion that involves students going to the chalkboard and the document camera to present their work and thinking and the class discusses. Again, I am more of a facilitator and my role is to highlight and clarify and bring out the most important ideas and reinforce them. Then, students receive homework to practice what they learn. I assign fewer homework problems now, maybe about 7, when I assigned about 30 per night to junior high students, but each of the 7 tasks requires a great deal of diagramming, explaining, etc., because the goals of the course are to develop conceptual understanding among the prospective teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nature of my teaching changed because I changed how I think about teaching over time, and I had a heavier balance on procedural fluency than conceptual understanding or problem solving as a junior high mathematics teacher (this would be different if I taught junior high today!), and I have a heavier balance on conceptual understanding now as a college professor of mathematics for future teachers -- because this is what my students need. They already have strong procedural fluency. What they need is to understand the meanings behind the procedures in order to be more effective teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the work of teaching not only is shaped by our level of teaching (junior high, high school, college), but also it is shaped by our goals for our students' learning. That's such an important point that I'd like to end with that.

We should use it, especially to guess what we would like to prove. However, then, we ought to prove our claims.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to start with dividing mathematical problems into two groups:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;straightforward problems&lt;/em&gt;, where mechanical work is enough,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;complex problems&lt;/em&gt;, where there has to be something more in the proof.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intuition comes with a cost of introducing errors, and while dealing with problems from the first category we should avoid it unless it outperforms the cost of manipulating overcomplicated expressions. However, while solving a problem from the second group we &lt;em&gt;have to use intuition&lt;/em&gt;, there is no other way (well, we could ask someone or do a brute-force search, but in most cases this is infeasible).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quite long digression about automated theorem proving:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a whole research area called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;automated theorem proving&lt;/a&gt; which tries to make computers prove theorems. It is worth noting that there are results, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_conjecture&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Robbins conjecture&lt;/a&gt; which eluded humans, but were proved by machines. However, there is a vast number of results that are inaccessible to machines (existence of such problems is implied, for example, by undecidability of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;halting problem&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to emphasize one aspect which makes theorem proving hard. It is not exactly right, because right now the use of many various heuristics allows computers to solve a multitude of practical problems. Nevertheless, the core issue did not disappear and shows itself in more complicated cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned issue is that, if the proof behaves in some non-monotone way, the computers are unable to guess the appropriate middle formula that would connect the premises and the thesis. For example, the proofs are usually of the form &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\textit{premises} \to \textit{something} \to \textit{thesis}.$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The proof would be straightforward if one could deduce &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; going forward from &lt;em&gt;premises&lt;/em&gt; or going backward from &lt;em&gt;thesis&lt;/em&gt; (perhaps doing both). However, it might happen that the inference looks like&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\textit{premises} \to \ldots \to p \land (p \to q) \to q \to \ldots \to \textit{thesis}.$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Observe that there is a some form of non-monotonicity between $p$ and $(p \to q)$, namely, the weaker $p$ is, the easier it is to prove it from the premises, but the harder it is to prove $(p \to q)$; the stronger $p$ is, the easier is for $(p \to q)$ but the more difficult for $p$. Independent of whether we go forwards from &lt;em&gt;premises&lt;/em&gt; or backwards from &lt;em&gt;thesis&lt;/em&gt;, we might have to check an impossible number of paths before we decide if the theorem is true (produce a proof) or not (produce a counterexample).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we had to prove two theorems, first $\textit{premises} \to p \land (p \to q)$ and the second $p \land (p \to q) \to \textit{thesis}$, then it would be much easier (provided there's no similar situation inside the subparts).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a professor who said, that it is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;modus ponens / rule of detachment&lt;/a&gt; where the genius in the proof hides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hardness is to know the middle lemma that makes the proof work. In other words, the difficulty lies in &lt;em&gt;what we try to prove&lt;/em&gt;, all the rest is straightforward (of course, that does not mean easy). A great example of this phenomenon are theorems which we have to strengthen to make them easier prove (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/q/448967/26306&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for some concrete examples).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it is the &lt;em&gt;intuition&lt;/em&gt; that tells us what to prove. It is a necessary component of any research that deals with more that just a straightforward tasks. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the best leader we have – we don't have anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it is great to use intuition and to encourage the students to use it. &#xA;Every time I can, I encourage them to train their intuition. &#xA;Nevertheless, there is an important part: we have to actually prove our results. Intuition might be great, but it will not substitute for a proof. There is nothing wrong with having bad intuition if we learn from our mistakes. Once we will start forming a proof, we gain more and more understanding that will correct our intuition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some suggested that they alternate between trying to prove the hypothesis and finding a counterexample. From my perspective both actions deepen our understanding and indirectly correct our intuitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intuition should be trained and that can't be done without using it. Perhaps our solution will be inferior or suboptimal, but thanks to that, next time our approach we will be better. On the other hand, if we were to keep using the same techniques again and again, we won't advance as much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer your second question, I don't believe there is any general way to determine how much intuition do you need in any particular domain. I would say &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; is the best you can do, but even then the new generations might have a whole different view, i.e. new tools and techniques might allow for new points of view that might turn everything upside-down. In fact, if you understand some result deep enough, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; intuitive (despite how non-intuitive it might seem to others).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps $\ddot\smile$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2014-04-07T22:09:14.027" LastActivityDate="2014-04-07T22:09:14.027" CommentCount="1" />

The reason is that the modern math is built upon previous results and reinventing the wheel is not a good strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, there are three solutions I would consider:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Give full credit.&lt;/em&gt; The solution might be wrong, but you don't expect the students to recognize the difficulty (perhaps even the teacher missed it at first). One can give bonus points to those who did.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Give partial credit.&lt;/em&gt; The fact that some respectable author got it wrong is &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; indication that it might be a &quot;reasonable mistake&quot;, that is, the approach could be mostly correct but for some subtlety that is non-intuitive and hard to spot. Partial credit is always tricky, though.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grade it like everything else (perhaps no credit).&lt;/em&gt; Wrong solution is not a valid solution independent of where it comes from. If the students think the solution is good enough to copy it, they are wrong and should be graded accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My preferred one is the third: in math the meaning of &lt;em&gt;authority&lt;/em&gt; is slightly different than in other areas and students should understand that nobody is exempt from following only valid inferences. On the other hand, it would be weird to enforce this rule unless you told the students about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Partial credit is the most common solution from my experience. Many professors grade not only what was written down, but also what kind of understanding the work implies. The solution might be incorrect, but the intuition behind it might be still valid. However, it is inherently hard to grade understanding and what is obvious from one perspective might be difficult from another point of view. The fact that the book's author got it wrong suggests that there is some other intuition that works just as good as yours (e.g. the rest of the book is great), but handles this particular case badly. Therefore, it could still seem like an obvious mistake to me, but I might opt to give some more points nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rarely, but it happens, you may want to give full credit. I don't like it, but I see why someone might want to use this solution. One case is when you don't want to bother students with subtleties, for example &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;in some engineer classes, where theory is secondary at best, you could accept solutions that miss the fact that some matrix could be singular in a problem where a random distortion of input data fixes the problem;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;in a discrete math course, some series-related theorems work only with proper convergence arguments, however, appropriate techniques/formalizations might be too hard or not that important (e.g. the topic wasn't covered in depth); a correct, formal solution would be to guess the result using the incorrect derivation, and then proceed by induction (or whatever), but some deem such a level of scrutiny unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another case is when the problem set wasn't tested enough. There was an exam once in my student times where the lecturers did a mistake about what works and what does not. In result, one task came out much, much harder than it was meant to be. Most students missed the subtlety (i.e. used the same solution that the lecturers thought it worked), others did notice and presented a counterexample. There was an announcement and both types were accepted with a perfect score.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps $\ddot\smile$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="42" LastEditorUserId="42" LastEditDate="2014-04-07T19:47:10.413" LastActivityDate="2014-04-07T19:47:10.413" CommentCount="1" />

This theorem can be applied: you can produce examples in your Fablab. Explaining how different this is from Banach-Tarski is half the job of teaching Banach-Tarski, and I do not think that talking about the unknown possible future discovery in physics is more than barely relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Another major point is that the pieces in the Banach-Tarski decomposition are not mathematically definable in any explicit way (we know that Banach-Tarski fails in some models of ZF: AC is really needed, not an artifact of the proof). Asking for the physical feasibility is at least one step beyond the true issue. And one should not let student think that the axiom of choice is just as any theorem; and in fact the Banach-Tarski paradox can be a good motivation to exclude it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you say: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We know many parts of mathematics which use Axiom of Choice in their&#xA;  main theorems (e.g. Analysis, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations,&#xA;  etc.) have amazingly correct applications in the actual world. Why&#xA;  Banach-Tarski theorem is an exception? Is it really an exception?!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;you are missing an important point: the parts of analysis, linear algebra, differential equations that really use the axiom of choice have certainly no physical relevance or practical application either; I defy anyone to give one convincing one.

Note that all elements of $SO(2)$ can be represented in terms of a continuously-varying parameter $\theta$, but not uniquely, and use that fact to interpret $SO(2)$ as the points on a circle.  Focus on two key ideas:  (i) The group contains infinitely many elements, but is unlike the &quot;discrete&quot; examples (like $\mathbb{Z}$) that they already know about because of its intrinsic &quot;continuity&quot; (I would not formally define or prove anything about the continuity but simply rely on the intuition that circles are smooth curves, and leave it at that.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second example:  $U(1)$.

My feeling is that typical differences among students in general would be first order effects, while issues facing someone coming from a computer science background would be second order effects that get drowned out (at the population level) by the first order effects. In fact, your background in number theory and combinatorics probably make you better prepared for real analysis than many (most?) students are after the standard calculus, ODE, and linear algebra courses taken in the first two years of college.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I suggest is that you visit a university library, bringing a pen and paper to write on, and spend two or three hours browsing the shelves. Real analysis texts will be mostly located in the vicinity of QA 300 to QA 330 Library of Congress classification. Read the prefaces of the texts on the shelves, and perhaps even photocopy the prefaces along with the tables of contents. Jot down titles of books that look interesting, either for primary study or for secondary reading. Make a note of how frequently the book was checked out or how worn out from reader use the book seems. Then do some online searching to see what others say about the various books. Keep in mind that a book no one talks about could still be very good. Most people are only aware of the books they used and perhaps a few other books, and most people commenting online probably have little knowledge of anything that hasn't been widely used in the last 30 years. For example, I think John F. Randolph's &lt;strong&gt;Basic Real And Abstract Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the best beginning graduate level real analysis texts I know of, but because it appeared in 1968 and because it is an awkward fit for most mathematics programs (too advanced for most undergraduate courses, too leisurely for most graduate courses; in this respect it is a bit like Neal L. Carothers' text &lt;strong&gt;Real Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;), there is virtually no discussion of Randolph's book anywhere online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good time to visit such a library is a week or two after final exams, because a lot of books that had been checked out will be returned and the library staff will have had time to reshelve the books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early this morning I went through a lot of papers I have related to the teaching of real analysis and made a list of those that could be of use to you if you're especially interested in discussions about students' difficulties in real analysis and people's thoughts on how to minimize these difficulties. I am not including papers that would be mainly of interest to those whose primary focus is on mathematics education rather than on mathematics, because despite this being a mathematics education group, your interest is in mathematics. [The difference for me is whether the paper appeared to be primarily about mathematical ideas or to be primarily about psychological and sociological aspects of learning mathematical ideas.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDITIONAL BOOKS THAT MAY BE WORTH LOOKING AT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt; Robert Lee Brabenec, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/resources-for-the-study-of-real-analysis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources for the Study of Real Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Classroom Resource Materials, Mathematical Association of America, 2004, xii + 231 pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[2]&lt;/strong&gt; Andrew Michael Bruckner, Judith Brostoff Bruckner, and Brian Sheriff Thomson, &lt;a href=&quot;http://classicalrealanalysis.info/com/FREE-PDF-DOWNLOADS.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elementary Real Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Prentice-Hall, 2001, xvi + 677 + 58 pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The final 58 pages consist of appendixes: (A) &lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt; (B) &lt;em&gt;Hints for Selected Exercises&lt;/em&gt; (C) &lt;em&gt;Subject Index&lt;/em&gt;.

For this particular course, well-designed plots can help to understand the idea behind certain definitions and theorems. For instance, you can show that, in order to show convergence of a sequence, it doesn't suffice to check the first few elements. Consider three series like $$a_n = \frac{1000}{n} - 1, \quad b_n= \sin\left(\frac{n}{900}\right), c_n= \frac{n}{1000},$$ where you can see that their behavior shouldn't be judged on the first 10 or 100 elements.

For example, after introducing the rule $\frac{d}{dx}x^{n}=nx^{n-1}$ (the &lt;em&gt;power rule&lt;/em&gt;) and giving some examples with polynomials (and what I used to call &quot;polynomial-like functions&quot;, which includes things like $\frac{2}{\sqrt{x}} – 2x\sqrt{x} + 5x^{1/3} + x^{3}),$ I would introduce the &lt;em&gt;general power rule&lt;/em&gt;, which is $\frac{d}{dx}u^{n}=nu^{n-1}\frac{du}{dx}$ where $u$ is some function of $x.$ This was usually abbreviated as $(u^n)'=nu^{n-1}u',$ and I would indicate how the power rule is the special case when $u(x)=x.$  Each of the functions $e^{x},$ $\ln{x},$ $\sin{x},$ etc. come with their own general version --- the &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; $e^{x}$ &lt;em&gt;rule&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;general logarithm rule&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;general sine rule&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On tests (especially on gateway type tests) and on 5-minute quizzes I would include what I called &lt;em&gt;abstract types&lt;/em&gt;, such as find the derivative with respect to $x$ of $\sin{f(x)}$ or find the derivative with respect to $x$ of $\;x^{2} \ln{(f(x) + x^{3})}.$ Of course, these types were done in class and given in homework, the latter being supplementary problems assigned (this code for that dirty word, &lt;em&gt;worksheets&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was only after students were (for the most part) fairly comfortable with these rules, both the specific versions and the general versions, and they were comfortable with evaluating derivatives of &quot;abstract types&quot;, that I would bring up the even more abstract idea of &lt;strong&gt;having a general function on the outside&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, the derivative with respect to $x$ of $f(x)$ is $f'(x)$ (no surprise), and the corresponding general version is $\frac{d}{dx}f(u) = f'(u)u'.$ But before giving this, I would make a column on the board to show the pattern of all our general rules. The column would have 5 or 6 functions like $e^{u},$ $\ln{u},$ $\sin{u},$ etc. lined up so that in one vertical line we'd see all the $f'(u)\,$'s appearing and just to the right of these we'd see in another vertical line all the $u'\,$'s appearing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At some point I would give one or more of the standard &quot;analogy justifications&quot; (e.g. bicycle gears), as well as various alternate notations such as the &quot;little circle&quot; composition notation and the Leibniz version where fraction cancellation seems to occur. However, all this came well after when I felt most students had fully internalized the formal technique. In this way the focus could be on the forest, without the tree leaves getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What follows is a slightly edited version of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5353194&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;4 November 2006&lt;/a&gt; post the &lt;em&gt;Chain Rule&lt;/em&gt; thread in the Math Forum discussion group &lt;em&gt;AP Calculus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's what I used to do regarding the &lt;em&gt;mechanics&lt;/em&gt; of carrying out the chain rule.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the function was, for example, $f(x) = \sin{(3x^{2} + 2)},$ then I'd write $f'(x) = \cos{(3x^2 + 2)} \cdot 6x,$ with a semi-circular arrow drawn over the top. The arrow's tail began just above (and roughly centered on) the $3x^2 + 2$ expression inside the cosine. The arrow curved in a concave down fashion (like the graph of $y=-x^2)$ to where the $6x$ was. I drew the arrow's head so that it pointed right at the $6x.$ When I was actually doing this, I drew the arrow after writing $\cos{(3x^2 + 2)}$ and before writing the dot and the $6x.$ I drew the arrow to &quot;remind us&quot; that there was more to do --- there's the derivative of the inside that still needed to be taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every &quot;inside&quot; got its own arrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{d}{dx}\sin{(3x^2 + e^{2x})} \;\; = \;\; \cos{(3x^2 + e^{2x})} \ldots$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;got $2$ arrows -- one arrow was for the sine (tail started at the $3x^2 + e^{2x}$ expression inside the cosine) and another arrow was for the exponential (tail started at the $2x$ that was inside the exponential which showed up &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; I had written down the term that the first arrow pointed to).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{d}{dx}\exp\,\{\,\sin\,[\cos\,(x^2)\,]\,\} \;\; = \;\; \exp\,\{\,\sin\,[\cos\,(x^2)\,]\,\} \ldots$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;got 3 arrows -- one for the $\exp,$ one for the $\sin,$ and one for the $\cos.$ In this case, the arrows humped horizontally across like the graph of $y = |\sin{x}|$ does on the closed interval $[0, \, 3\pi].$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Almost all of my students wrote their answers this way on tests, which was fine with me. I didn't require them to rewrite the derivative leaving out the arrows or require them to erase the arrows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, when I first introduced the product rule (or when a student later had difficulty), I found it helpful to insert a &lt;em&gt;parentheses tinplate&lt;/em&gt; before going further. Thus, when showing the use of the product rule for&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$f(x) \;\; = \;\; (3x^2 - 2x)^{3} \cdot \cos{3x},$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd first write&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$f'(x) \;\; = \;\; (\;\;\;\;\;)'*(\;\;\;\;\;) \;\; + \;\; (\;\;\;\;\;)*(\;\;\;\;\;)'.$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to get the students to see the big picture before we got into the details. Some teachers do this using rectangular boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I'd write the appropriate factor inside each pair of parentheses, not rewriting or doing anything else -- just copy the factor &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; as it was written.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$ (\,(3x^2 - 2x)^3\,)' * (\,\cos{3x}\,) \;\; + \;\; (\,(3x^2 - 2x)^3\,) * (\,\cos{3x}\,)'$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$(\,\text{one derivative goes here}\,) * (\,\cos{3x}\,) \;\; + \;\; (\,(3x^2 - 2x)^{3}\,) * (\, \text{other derivative goes here} \,)$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I told them: &quot;Now we're $3/4$ done!&quot; Most of the time we really weren't $3/4$ done, but this often generated laughs (especially when it was clear there was quite a bit involved in taking care of the two indicated derivatives), and I think it helped to put the more math-phobic students at ease. The &quot;$3/4$&quot; comes from having half of the problem taken care of with the setting up and filling in of the product rule tinplate, and having half of the parentheses parts already done (i.e. $2$ of the $4$ parentheses parts were freebies). If necessary, I'd go to another part of the board in order to work out each of the indicated derivatives and put the results where I wrote &quot;one derivative goes here&quot; and &quot;other derivative goes here&quot; in the last displayed expression above. I usually only did this (calculate the derivatives of the factors on another part of the board) the first day we covered the product rule, or when someone was having a lot of trouble with it later on, or when the function itself seemed to be scary looking to the students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="745" LastActivityDate="2014-04-08T15:54:02.190" CommentCount="0" />

Solomonoff inductive inference is rooted in Bayesian statistics and is the optimal procedure for drawing strong-as-possible conclusions from available data, which is what frequentist statistical inference (as I understand its aims, vaguely) also tries to do, albeit less efficiently. Since information is a commodity valued by (Solomonoff) inductive inference, and since frequentist statistical inference seems to be a largely parallel pursuit of the same aims under a different theoretical framework, we would expect information to be a valuable commodity to statistical inference in general.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get back to the point: Outliers are unlikely events (according to anyone tempted to dismiss them as fluke events, anyway) and therefore carry the most information within the sample (to that person) and therefore should be seen by that person as the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; valuable members of a sample. The desire to &quot;clean the data&quot; and get rid of them is diametrically misguided (unless an explanation has been provided for them, in which case they would no longer carry much information anyway since under that explanation they are no longer such low-probability events).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="783" LastEditorUserId="783" LastEditDate="2014-04-08T23:39:57.063" LastActivityDate="2014-04-08T23:39:57.063" CommentCount="1" />

But I think the best approach is via a plethora of examples meant to demonstrate the variety of uses of equivalence classes. I doubt there is a singular example that can open every student's mind to the concept of equivalence classes. That said, here are some examples I have used effectively:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; I have taught a &quot;transition to proofs&quot; course for a few years, and have included the following sequence of exercises. During the first few weeks or so, after working with sets and their notation, I assign this exercise:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's $\mathbb{Z}$ Point Of This Problem?&lt;/strong&gt;: In this problem, we are going to ''prove'' the existence of the negative integers! I say ''prove'' because we won't really understand what we've done until later but, trust me, it's what we're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Because of this goal, you cannot &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; any integers strictly less than 0 exist, so your algebraic steps, especially in part (d), should not involve any terms that might be negative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;That is, if you consider an equation like $x+y=x+z$, we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; deduce that $y=z$, by subtracting $x$ from both sides, since $x-x=0$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;However, if we consider an equation like $x+y=z+w$, we &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; deduce that $x-z=w-y$. Perhaps $y&amp;gt;w$, so $w-y$ does not exist in our context... On to the problem!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Let $P=\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$. Define the set $R$ by&#xA;  $$ R = \{((a,b),(c,d))\in P\times P\mid a+d=b+c\} $$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Find three different pairs $(c,d)$ such that $((1,4),(c,d))\in R$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Let $(a,b)\in P$. Prove that $((a,b),(a,b))\in R$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Let $((a,b),(c,d))\in R$. Prove that $((c,d),(a,b))\in R$, as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Assume $((a,b),(c,d))\in R$ and $((c,d),(e,f))\in R$. Prove that $((a,b),(e,f))\in R$, as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I pose this mainly as a &quot;can you understand new notation and write a proof about it&quot; problem, and say as much to the students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But a few weeks later on, when we're talking about equivalence relations, I bring up this exercise again. I even write a passage in our book about this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Remember that crazy exercise from Chapter 3 that had you prove something about a set of pairs of pairs of natural numbers, and we claimed that was proving something about the existence of the integers? What was that all about? Look back at the exercise now, Exercise [reference]. You'll see that the last three parts of the problem have you prove that the set $R$ we defined is an &lt;em&gt;equivalence relation&lt;/em&gt; on the set $P=\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$. Look at that! You proved $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What that exercise showed is that (essentially, we are glossing over some details here) any negative integer is represented as the &lt;em&gt;equivalence class&lt;/em&gt; of pairs of integers whose difference is that negative integer. That is,&#xA;  $$ -1\;\; \text{''}=\text{''}\;\; [(1,2)]_R = \{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),\dots\} $$&#xA;  and, for another example,&#xA;  $$ -3\;\;\text{''}=\text{''}\;\; [(1,4)]_R=\{(1,4),(2,5),(3,6),\dots\}$$&#xA;  This is only an intuitive explanation and not rigorous, mathematically speaking, but that's the idea!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the students who might already be inclined to think abstractly and want to pursue higher math, this is a great teaser, and has led to many discussions in office hours about set theory, logic, and so on. For other students, it's a reminder that exercises from the past weren't done in a vacuum; they have a meaning, and can teach us new things. And for every student, it's at least a reminder that math is interconnected in ways we might not expect, a priori.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; An in-class example I like to discuss involves comparing an equivalence relation to a similar (non-equivalence) relation that is meant to &quot;encode the same information&quot;. I include the following example in the text, and follow up on it with an in-class discussion, which also serves to point out the distinction between &quot;a relation from $A$ to $B$&quot; and a &quot;relation on $A$&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Let $S$ be the set of students in our class. Define a relation $R_1$ between $S$ and $\mathbb{N}$ by saying $(s,n)\in R_1$ if person $s\in S$ is $n$ years old.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Now, define a relation $R_2$ on $S$ itself by saying $(s,t)\in R_2$ if persons $s$ and $t$ are the same age (in years).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How do the relations $R_1$ and $R_2$ compare? Do they somehow ''encode'' the same information about the elements of the set $S$? Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; You mention $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, naturally. I think it behooves us to show &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this is useful, not just &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; it's an equivalence relation. In the past, I have demonstrated exemplary uses via the Chinese Remainder Theorem, Fermat's Little Theorem, etc. But I've found that the most striking (and convincing) uses are ''smaller'', computationally, and serve to show how previously tedious arguments can be cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a standard induction problem asks a student to show $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ that $6\mid n^3+5n$. A standard induction argument requires some algebraic manoeuvering, and ends up being entirely unenlightening for the beginning student (for whom this is meant to be practice relating to the &lt;em&gt;inductive&lt;/em&gt; nature of such relationships). Instead, I go back and use mod 6 and say, ''There are 6 cases. Either $n$ is congruent to 0,1,2,3,4,5 modulo 6. In each case, we see...'' And there they have it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, consider proving that any perfect square is either a multiple of 4 or one more than a multiple of 4. This can be good practice working with formal definitions (''multiple of 4 means there exists $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that...'') but it's far more ''fun'' for them to just see that $0^2\equiv 2^2\equiv 0$ and $1^2\equiv 3^2\equiv 1$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, divisibility tricks are fun, too. I find that college students are well aware of the ''casting out 3s/9s'' trick, but are wholly unaware of how it works. Setting up a mod 10 congruence to prove it really shows some &quot;aha&quot;s and smiles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, I don't think it's necessary to show a typical undergraduate the sophisticated concept of ''modding out'' a set by an equivalence relation. In a classroom setting, it usually suffices to whet their appetite by showing students the &lt;em&gt;utility&lt;/em&gt; of equivalence relations in various settings. (In the examples above, this means (1) formally defining $\mathbb{Z}$ from $\mathbb{N}$, (ii) comparing an equivalence relation and a ''regular'' relation, and (iii) using equivalence classes to clean up a formerly ''messy'' argument.) If particular students are intrigued by this, then you might foster further discussions, either in class or in office hours (depending on the popularity/prevalence).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastActivityDate="2014-04-09T04:49:47.000" CommentCount="0" />

Ultimately, the authority in mathematics is that any one of us can use what we have learned, even via different methods, to verify what other people have done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In mathematics classrooms, we do not learn only mathematical rules and structure. We learn to think mathematically. And this involves learning something about our identity relative to &quot;mathematics.&quot; Valuable things for your students to learn:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every one of them can wield mathematical authority; that's the power of learning mathematics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In mathematics (and in science, and in life) we have some responsibility to trustworthiness, which means an attitude of eagerness to be challenged. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Justification is not an inconvenient response to a challenge, it is a vital mathematical practice&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We should avoid anything that teaches the student that making a mistake is something to be ashamed of; when students learn that, they begin to attribute their own mistakes to &quot;not being good at math.&quot; They start to believe that someone &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; at math would not have made that mistake. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A teacher who is relying on cultivating the air of an infallible mathematical authority will have a hard time conveying important aspects of mathematics to the students. But worse, that concern seems to put one's own personal emotional well-being ahead of the students' learning. If this façade helps you avoid challenges from the students, is it for their good, or is it ego-driven? It's a question educators should at least consider. Who benefits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If students learn from you that even teachers make mistakes, but yet they persevere in correcting them, they may see themselves as possibly reaching your level, with some work. Isn't that, ultimately, our goal as mathematics educators? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought I would offer one peek into the implications of the development identity in mathematics classrooms, since I am interested broadly in STEM education and how people come to see themselves as entering STEM fields. Jo Boaler has done research on the implications of different models of teaching in math classrooms, and one perspective she has used to compare traditional and more heavily discussion-based classrooms is to look at the developing identities of the students. One brief excerpt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfu.ca/~sbc7/joboaler.pdf&quot;&gt;one of Prof. Boaler's papers&lt;/a&gt; illustrates some of what students say when they begin to think mathematics is not for them:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The disaffected students we interviewed were being turned away from&#xA;  mathematics because of pedagogical practices that are unrelated to the&#xA;  nature of mathematics (Burton, 1999a, b). Most of the students who&#xA;  told us about their rejection of mathematics in the 4 didactic&#xA;  classrooms – 9 girls and 5 boys, all successful mathematics students –&#xA;  had decided to leave the discipline because they wanted to pursue&#xA;  subjects that offered opportunities for expression, interpretation and&#xA;  human agency. In contrast, those students who remained motivated and&#xA;  interested in the traditional classes were those who seemed happy to&#xA;  ‘receive’ knowledge and to be relinquished of the requirement to think&#xA;  deeply:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;J: I always like subjects where there is a definite right or wrong&#xA;    answer.  That’s why I’m not a very inclined or good English student.&#xA;    Because I don’t  really think about how or why something is the way it&#xA;    is. I just like math  because it is or it isn’t. (Jerry, Lemon school)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, there was a sort of filtering process going on in heavily didactic classrooms, teaching students to select themselves out of mathematics if they were interested in having control of their own choices (human agency), self-expression, and interpretation. The students who stayed interested were ones who felt relieved at the lack of complexity of &quot;one right answer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the students in a more discussion-oriented calculus classroom did not see mathematics learning as conflicting with their developing identities as expressive, interpretive people with personal agency. Part of the difference between these two types of classroom is in how authority is seen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's more than just how mistakes are handled, of course. I offered this example to show that there is much more going on in math classrooms, and part of it is very important to how students determine what they are going to put their effort into.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something to consider!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Works Cited&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Boaler, J.

There are lots of students these days that seem to think maths is something they can never be good at and that if you are good at maths it means you are some sort of wierdo with a brain that functions completely differently to theirs.  However this isn't true and it can give the students confidence in their own ability to see that you make mistakes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also teach programming and quite often I use lecture time to demonstrate how to go about writing and debugging programs by writing a non-trivial bit of code live during the lecture.

One of the benefits of this is that I can show them how to go about writing programs in a way that limits your opportunity for mistakes and that makes fixing them as easy as possible.  The same is true for maths, the fact that you make mistakes is a good way of teaching the importance of checking your maths as yo go, and if there is time to see if you can get the same result by a different method.

It is possible for the paper to fail to communicate; if you are unable to decipher points of the paper, then they have not merely failed in an ELA sense.

While it may not be part of their grade consideration, and it need not be something you spend additional time on, you can probably provide some useful ELA feedback to them. You may note that there are grammar problems, that spelling is an issue, that there is a problem with the coherence from paragraph to paragraph, etc. These comments can be useful to students even if a grade is not dependent on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="759" LastActivityDate="2014-04-09T13:07:46.090" CommentCount="0" />

However, consider the following case: a few decades ago a new medicine against heart diseases was developed. It worked well. However, 10 years later someone observed, that the rate of people dying of cancer was much higher among those who have been treated with the new medicine, in fact, the rate of cancer increased by a significant margin. Mass hysteria ensues: the new medicine causes cancer! Bans are being issued, companies are sued, etc. until a better look at the statistics showed that the situation was exactly the same as in the case of the egg-laying dog: people are not immortal, and sooner or later they tend to die of &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. As fewer people died of heart diseases, they died of other causes years or decades later, and cancer, being a leading cause of death especially among older people, was one of them. The new medicine was not causing cancer at all, it just decreased the rate of another disease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other interesting, commonly occurring examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Regression toward the mean: people, especially bosses tend to think that scolding people when they perform badly improves their effectiveness and complimenting them when they perform well decreases it.

In fact, it is a word I've used in the past.  I'd like to warn that there is at least one competing definition for &quot;tautology&quot; applied to a first order formula. This is that a formula is a tautology if and only if it is an instance of a propositional tautology. For example $x=0 \vee \neg(x=0)$ is a tautology, as it is an instance of $P\vee \neg P$, but $2+2=4$ is not a tautology. As I said in the OP, I wanted to be consistent with the standard logical terminology, so that ruled out &quot;tautology&quot; for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ended up with &quot;universally true&quot;.  For context, this is a computing course and the kinds of formulas we typically deal with describe states of the computer. E.g. $x=y$ describes all state in which a location called &quot;x&quot; contains the same value as the location called &quot;y&quot;. Usually the right question to ask about such a formula is not whether it is &quot;true&quot; or not, but which states is it true of.  This is the reason I preferred not to use simply &quot;true&quot;. &quot;Law&quot; and &quot;fact&quot; are to me slightly more suggestive than &quot;true&quot;, but I didn't think that they went far enough in emphasizing the universality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'll note that Dijkstra and Scholten in their book &lt;em&gt;Predicate Calculus and Program Semantics&lt;/em&gt; use the square brackets as an operator which they call &quot;everywhere&quot;. This operator is applied to what they call &quot;Boolean structures&quot;, which are essentially the same as what most of us would call Boolean functions. For them $x\le y\Rightarrow x+1&amp;gt;y$ is a boolean &quot;structure&quot; which is true for some states and false for others, while $[x\le y\Rightarrow x+1&amp;gt;y] = \mathit{true}$. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="527" LastEditorUserId="527" LastEditDate="2014-04-14T20:32:44.663" LastActivityDate="2014-04-14T20:32:44.663" CommentCount="0" />

(That said, I don't try to claim that I always live up to the ideal described here; in fact, I'm still far from it...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, I find that making a bit fun of it is a good way to cope with the natural stress of such a situation.  A few other running gags I employ are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, you see, I'm an idiot, but don't tell that to my dean, 'cause he's going to fire me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm lucky I already passed this course.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that (besides being funny, though your mileage may vary on that) it's quite formative for students to see that their teacher: (i) also is a human being and makes mistakes, (ii) does not have a problem with admitting it, and (iii) does not treat himself &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; easy, and requires some effort to develop such an attitude (and even then, it does not work all the time, obviously).  But my experience tells me that especially the trait described in (iii) is very useful here (and also in general).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, some time ago I did an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; stupid mistake of making a bad drawing (it was an elementary geometry problem) and discarding a &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; answer because it didn't fit to my bad drawing.  Even though I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; embarrassed (so it must have been a really stupid mistake), since it was an introductory course for freshmen, I decided that it's too good an opportunity to waste it, and I did a mini-lecture on how bad drawings can hinder our reasoning.

I did this because I thought the underlying principle was important enough (average of velocities doesn't have to equal average velocity), especially in calculus 1, and it was an easy way to get most students to master something somewhat relevant to the material without putting in a lot of class time. Usually in college algebra and precalculus classes I would work it on the board for them the first time, and in calculus classes I left it up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{(2n^3 – n^2 + 6)^4(3n-7)^3}{n(1+7n)(2+3n^2)^2(3+4n^3)^3}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I often put something like this on a calculus 2 quiz on a day when I wanted to review limits of rational functions (e.g. for ratio test with series convergence), with the review being at a more mathematically mature level than was probably the case when they covered this in precalculus or calculus 1. By &quot;more mathematically mature level&quot;, I mean knowing the idea of using dominate terms and being able to quickly find the dominate terms. I'd work the extra credit problem to demonstrate the idea:&#xA;$$\frac{(2n^3 – n^2 + 6)^4(3n-7)^3}{n(1+7n)(2+3n^2)^2(3+4n^3)^3} \;\; = \;\; \frac{(2^4n^{12} + \cdots)(3^3n^3 + \cdots)}{n(7n + \cdots)(3^2n^4 + \cdots)(4^3n^9 + \cdots)}$$&#xA;$$= \;\; \frac{2^43^3n^{15} + \cdots}{3^24^3\cdot7n^{15} + \cdots} \;\; \longrightarrow \;\; \frac{2^43^3}{3^24^3\cdot7} \;\; = \;\; \frac{2^43^3}{2^63^2\cdot7} \;\; = \;\; \frac{3}{2^2\cdot7} \;\; = \;\; \frac{3}{28}$$&#xA;This specific example came from a quiz given to a very strong high school class, by the way.

It's a standard type, but students will remember the trick better if they struggle with it a bit on a quiz (or hour test). The idea, of course, is that the square root function is not an additive function, so you want to let $u = 2x-1$ (and not $u = 6x-1).$ Then you have to &quot;force&quot; the substitution by solving for $x$ in terms of $u$ in order to express $(6x – 1)^2$ in terms of $u.$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Find the unique solution to the following ODE that contains the point $\left( 0,\,1\right).$ Express your answer as $y$ solved in terms of $x,$ making use of the error function.

I'm certain the extra time I gave them for the quiz (I probably give them 20 minutes for what was otherwise a 10-minute quiz) was more than made up by their retention of the idea and by their attention to my working it out after the quiz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="745" LastActivityDate="2014-04-09T21:36:47.060" CommentCount="2" />

Instead, you should strive to use various notations freely enough&#xA;so that they're all instinctive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I fell prey to this back when I was taking undergraduate classes, and I wish my professors had made a point to use more notations, so that they would be natural to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I'm teaching, this is primarily about using both Newton and Leibniz notation for differentiation.

In fact, this is extremely useful. It also allows me to modify and change wording, examples, and problems based on direct feedback from my students. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I am also very happy to not force students to buy these texts, given that the information itself is readily available online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the option, I would choose to use an open-source text for essentially any lower-level class (precalc, calc, linear algebra, statistics, etc.). I don't know about upper-level classes, for which there often exist great books that are extremely well-written and which don't change from year to year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I don't usually have that option, at least not from my current position. And many professors I know don't have that option either. The university expects consistency, and lower-level classes are those often taught by multiple people at a time. For all of us to use a modified version of an open-source text requires all of us to agree on modifications/the text. At the very least, university policy and bureaucracy make this much harder. (I suppose it would just take the person in charge, if there is a person in charge, to make a solid decision and to commit - but this has not been my experience).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, in my experience, I find that most open-source textbooks &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; some revision for one reason or another. This limits them to the ones whose source is actually available, rather than those that are just free and which get lumped in. And the problem here is that authors get to make up their own notations/TeX conventions, which can make it very unpleasant to actually modify their text. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For that matter, writing a text at all is time-consuming and hard. It's hard to write clearly, it's hard to make pretty pictures (&lt;strong&gt;really hard&lt;/strong&gt;).

This topic also allows for a lot of examples, many of which the students will have seen without the formality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final topic, construction of the reals, is a little bit different, in that many of the proofs involved will be a lot harder.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But it does introduce some quite nice things to the students, since the construction of something as the set of equivalence classes of something else is done a lot in mathematics (in some sense one might call it the way mathematicians &quot;patch&quot; sets to obtain missing objects, such as in this case obtaining the limits of sequences that should converge but do not, by declaring the sequence itself to represent its limit).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;At the same time, this topic will have the students do several epsilon-delta proofs, which is something most students at this level will still need to practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The course in question used the book Chapter Zero by Carol Schumacher, which I heartily recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="286" LastActivityDate="2014-04-10T09:25:00.570" CommentCount="0" />

So, my question is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you think, what is more important at a lecture: 1) to give a rigorous proof or 2) only formulate a statement and give an intuitive understanding via illustrative examples?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.:&lt;/strong&gt; I understand that it would be great to do both.

If their interest is theoretical, then they might be able to cope with radians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My use-case that switched my attitude was that of graphical programming.  I frequently want to draw something on the screen rotated by some angle.  I'm far more likely to want to rotate it by some fraction of a circle than anything else, so I want to work with proportions of a full circle.  At this point, I could use degrees, gradians, or radians equally well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key, though, is in the accuracy of specification and storage of that angle.  I want to know that if I rotate by a sixth of a circle and do it six times then I will rotate by a full circle.  Now, for a sixth then the discrepancy is unlikely to be that great, but in fact I'll do this for much smaller angles.  However I specify the angle, the resulting matrix is not going to be exact due to precision issues.  So continually composing the matrix will eventually diverge from what it should be.  Therefore my best strategy is to keep track of the angle and compute the matrix from the angle each time.  But this won't work if my angle is not precise.  So I want to be able to store the angle as precisely as I can.  And if I store &amp;pi; or &amp;tau; or some fraction thereof, it will only ever be an approximation.  But if I store 10 or 20 or 30 then I can store it exactly and do exact calculations on it, thereby minimising the error in the final transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then why degrees instead of gradians or just proportions?  The reason to discard just proportions is that most computer programs do not handle fractions exactly &quot;out of the box&quot; whereas they do handle integers exactly.  So for the range of values we're actually interested in, it is more efficient to work with multiples of a fixed small angle than work with fractions of the whole.

If students are not happy with the definitions, you can give them note how mathematics works and that definitions are coming at last in order to summarize technical properties needed for some theorems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians should have intuition to work. However, intuition should come from working a lot with definitions and experience; &quot;real world ideas&quot; can sometimes be very confusing. If everything comes from real world intuition, why do you need people doing mathematics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important point is: What are definitions good for? Of course, you can introduce some definition and find out what functions hold that property and which don't. But if you define something, you want to work with it! The task is not to find out which functions are continuous, but to find out: For which function can I use the 100 theorems which holds if the function is continuous! (A similar example: When I was in school, I always wondered if zero is a natural number of not and I believed that mathematicians are doing research about that topic; but later I realized that this is insignificant: There are theorems stating: Something holds for every natural number and sometimes, I have to exclude zero and sometimes zero has to be included.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, there are (like in your first example) &quot;empty&quot; consequences from a definition. Good point is that it does not contradict the definition. At first, to say that these function is continuous is like an answer to a question no one would like ask. At that point, you can explain (like I said before): You are interested to use some often used arguments like: &lt;em&gt;If $f(x)\neq 0$ holds for some $x$, then this holds in a sufficiently small neighborhood of $x$.&lt;/em&gt; This is true if the function is continuous. If you have a function which is continuous only as an &quot;empty&quot; consequence, even the question is useless, since &lt;em&gt;there is not neighborhood of $x$, where the function is defined&lt;/em&gt;. At that point, students might suggest a modification of the definition of continuity to only define it for domains having not singular points. You can then say that is is possible to include that, but then the definition is longer and for all excluded cases, the consequences are &lt;strong&gt;not wrong, but irrelevant&lt;/strong&gt;. And you can give an outlook that there a generalizations (in topology) where continuity can in general not be related to some real world intuition and you don't want to get rid of the additional empty examples (e.g., $f(K)$ is compact if $K$ is compact and $f$ is continuous). [I'm not sure how much one wants to go into detail there.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to your second example, I must say that I was very annoyed as a student for such &quot;counterexamples&quot;, since most students would say: Okay, let's look at the same function on a different domain and everything works fine.

Martin Gardner is probably the main go-to, but &quot;The Art and Craft of Problem Solving&quot; (Zeitz) or the classic &quot;Polyominoes&quot; (Golomb) might fit the bill, too. Some other books I like are &quot;The Tokyo Puzzles&quot; (Fujimura) and &quot;The Simple Book of Not-So-Simple Puzzles&quot; (Grabarchuks). There is yet another book, which has a title meant somewhat as a &quot;jape,&quot; called &quot;More Games for the Super-intelligent&quot; (Fixx). Here is an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The mere fact that you are reading this book [on puzzles] by no means grants you license to urge its contents on those who are not similarly committed. The only safe procedure is to acknowledge the fact that in your liking for puzzles you are different from other people. Revel privately, if you want to, in that difference, but do not - under any circumstances - undertake even the gentlest of proselytizing. That way lies nothing but disaster. Remember: you are an intellectual at play, not a missionary... I think, we must choose our puzzles companions with care. We must not assume, until we have seen irrefutable evidence of it, the presence of an enthusiasm that may not exist at all. Rather, those of us who share an interest in puzzles should stick quietly together, welcoming outsiders whenever they chance to turn up, but never taking it for granted that they will (vi-vii).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not I agree entirely with Fixx, I can at least say that there are plenty of students for whom puzzles are not enjoyable, so one must be cautious in expecting any sort of interest-transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part two.&lt;/strong&gt; Looking at your definition of &lt;em&gt;puzzle&lt;/em&gt;, it essentially accords with the idea of a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; as contrasted with an &lt;em&gt;exercise&lt;/em&gt; (in the Mathematics Education literature). To this effect, I think books on problem solving or old examinations (such as the Putnam - but maybe stick to A1, A2, B1, B2 for pre-college...) could be useful sources for what you are looking for. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In distinguishing between a &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;exercise&lt;/em&gt;, one way to define the former is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;a question for which the method of solution is unknown at the outset&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This ought to satisfy your first three conditions, and asking that the problem be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; (elegant, interesting, etc.) should be enough for the fourth and final condition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2014-04-11T16:44:56.883" CommentCount="2" />

At that time, Netflix was a DVD rental service and users did rate the movies they have seen. Netflix had some algorithm which gave recommendations which movies a particular user could like and awarded 1 mio $ to the team which improved the algorithm by 10%. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rating was as follows: For all users $u\in U$ and all movies $m\in M$, there is a (possible) rating $r(u,m)\in\lbrace 0,1,2,3,4,5\rbrace$. There is a subset $K\subset U\times M$, for which the rating function is known. Netflix did a partition of $K$ into $K_{\text{known-to-everyone}}$ and $K_{\text{known-to-netflix}}$. The problem was then:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Find an approximating rating function $r_{\text{appr}}$ such that $\Vert r_{\text{appr}}(u,m)-r(u,m)\Vert_{K_{\text{known-to-netflix}}}$ subject to $r_{\text{appr}}(u,m)=r(u,m)$ on $K_{\text{known-to-everyone}}$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That means, everyone got the known data and should make some model to make good predictions (depending on a specific given norm) on unknown data only known to Netflix (who by that data found out which algorithm was good).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The documentation of the best algorithm is published; some other teams published their approach as well and used methods from constrained optimization.

An example source is the COMAP book &quot;For All Practical Purposes&quot; which includes sections on optimal entry (in elections), optimal production policies, and optimal schedules. There are plenty of other problems that don't have the word &quot;optimal&quot; in their name (e.g., bin packing). The book provides a wealth of examples; another nice one is fair division, which can be applied to scenarios ranging from company mergers to inheritance to organ transplant policies. Some of these are probably a bit removed from students' daily lives, but others are run into frequently. For instance, you could read over the literature on cake-division.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For three cake eaters, there is the Steinhaus Proportional Procedure; for four or more, there is the Banach-Knaster proportional procedure.

There is a good chance that League of Legends is a part of many of your students' daily life, especially if you are teaching engineering calculus. It doesn't have any sexual or deviant themes -- it is a game about teams of &quot;champions&quot; fighting in an arena -- so I've found it to be reasonable to bring it up in class. The reason to go this route is that &lt;strong&gt;many of your students might actually be encountering this optimization problem every day&lt;/strong&gt;. Here's the problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In League of Legends, a player's Effective Health when defending against physical damage is given by $E = \frac{H(100+A)}{100}$, where $H$ is health and $A$ is armor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(1) Health costs 2.5 gold per unit, and Armor costs 18 gold per unit. You have 3600 gold, and you need to optimize the effectiveness E of your health and armor to survive as long as possible against the enemy team's attacks. How much of each should you buy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can actually go further if you want to make it more complicated (and more accurate to what actually happens in the game!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(2) Ten minutes into the game, you have 1080 health and 10 armor. You have only 720 gold to spend, and again Health costs 2.5 gold per unit while Armor costs 18 gold per unit. Again the goal is to maximize the effectiveness E. Notice that you don't want to maximize the effectiveness of what you purchase -- you want to maximize the effectiveness E of your &lt;em&gt;resulting&lt;/em&gt; health and armor. How much of each should you buy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the last one is much more challenging, but it is something that even professional players of League of Legends (these exist!) can get incorrect:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(3) Thirty minutes into the game, you have 2000 health and 50 armor. You have 1800 gold to spend, and again Health costs approximately 2.5 gold per unit while Armor costs approximately 18 gold per unit. Again the goal is to maximize the effectiveness E of your &lt;em&gt;resulting&lt;/em&gt; health and armor. How much of each should you buy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of this problem is that the game is actually more complicated than this -- in reality you need to defend against both physical and magic damage by buying both armor and magic resistance, which adds another variable. So the &quot;punchline&quot; of the exercise is that &lt;strong&gt;you can't actually play the most popular PC game properly until you understand Lagrange multipliers. I'll see you in Multivariable Calculus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instructors answers (not student solutions!):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(1) You do not spend equal money on A and H: $E = 3H - \frac{1}{720}H^2$ so the maximum is at $H = 1080$, plug back in for $A = 50$. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(2) One way to do this is to realize from number 1 that we know an optimal configuration is $H = 1080$ and $A = 50$, so right now we have way too much health and not enough armor. The answer to this is that we should spend all the money on 40 armor, to get exactly back to the optimized answer to #1. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(3) If H and A are the amount they plan to buy, the effectiveness is $E = \frac{(H + 2000)(100 + (50 + A))}{100}$ since they started with 2000 and 50 respectively.  The critical point appears at H = -100, so the maximum actually occurs at one of the endpoints, not at the critical point at all.

Sketch explanations and history without grilling kids on it. Make it clear that mathematics is a human endeavor, can be legitimately questioned, but/and has many good answers. Many kids will not care much, but the meta-point that asking questions is legit is important to make by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For that matter, with a talented expositor, the &quot;why&quot; can very often be made far more interesting than &quot;drill in execution of algorithm&quot;.

In fact, this is an amazing point in comparison and contrast to much else that people see these days (as well as days long gone).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So: opportunities for further explanations for interested parties, and admission in general that there are explanations for those interested.

Consequently, $a = \pm \sqrt{b}$. $\Box$ &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On occasion you may encounter an instructor who says $x^2=4$ implies $x = \pm 2$ is not good work. Instead, you must show $x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2)=0$ thus $x = \pm 2$. Personally, I reject this philosophy because I think as we mature we ought to learn from our previous work and as we converse with individuals of similar training there is no need to rehash things which are already settled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you first learn factoring you ought to be forced to prove this theorem a few times. However, sometime, not too long after that, we should also learn that those details are so obvious that there is no common expectation those details are shown. In the same way, we teach difference quotients to begin our discussion of derivatives. But, only a silly person insists to use difference quotients and limits on problems which allow algebraic techniques from the family of &lt;strong&gt;theorems&lt;/strong&gt; we develop early in calculus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want students who leave my courses to know for certain the best way to calculate standard problems. If a substandard method is needed to motivate the definition then I want to make certain the demarcation between the motivating substructure and the optimal (theorem-based) calculation is crystal clear. I see the same for algebra: there are tricks (theorems) which help us to see past multiple steps which are closely tied to axioms of real numbers. If you can jump reliably from one point to another then it hardly makes sense to tip-toe just because you can. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is just as important to &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; theorems as to be able to prove them. This continues to be true at higher levels of mathematics.

In particular, if either of these constraints is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; satisfied, then the concept should be avoided for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This approach is admittedly simplistic, since there are lots of things that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be covered in a course, i.e., that are potentially within students' ken given enough time, but at the expense of other material. To develop such a framework further, then, one must at least have some idea of the course goals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frogs, Birds, and Chunking:&lt;/strong&gt; The &quot;frogs and birds&quot; metaphor refers to a notion introduced by Freeman Dyson in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200212p.pdf?q=and&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; where he begins:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Some mathematicians are birds, others&#xA;  are frogs. Birds fly high in the air and&#xA;  survey broad vistas of mathematics out&#xA;  to the far horizon. They delight in concepts that unify our thinking and bring&#xA;  together diverse problems from different parts of&#xA;  the landscape. Frogs live in the mud below and see&#xA;  only the flowers that grow nearby. They delight&#xA;  in the details of particular objects, and they solve&#xA;  problems one at a time. I happen to be a frog, but&#xA;  many of my best friends are birds. The main theme&#xA;  of my talk tonight is this. Mathematics needs both&#xA;  birds and frogs. Mathematics is rich and beautiful&#xA;  because birds give it broad visions and frogs give it&#xA;  intricate details. Mathematics is both great art and&#xA;  important science, because it combines generality&#xA;  of concepts with depth of structures. It is stupid&#xA;  to claim that birds are better than frogs because&#xA;  they see farther, or that frogs are better than birds&#xA;  because they see deeper. The world of mathematics is both broad and deep, and we need birds and&#xA;  frogs working together to explore it (p. 212).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dyson is discussing mathematicians, but you may wish to consider whether or not the discussion can be applied to students of mathematics, as well. Something like: Can students in mathematics classes be meaningfully divided into tadpoles and hatchlings?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My sense is that the answer, generally, is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;: There might exist certain preferences, but early on students are not to be classified in this way. Instead, you must elect to provide a mix of &quot;concepts that unify our thinking&quot; and &quot;details of particular objects.&quot; To share my own perception (and perhaps out myself as somewhat ranine), I think one must alternate between minor details, as objects are introduced, and broader comments as students' arsenal of examples grows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regard to &quot;chunking,&quot; I refer to studies on chessboard perceptions; an early one, comparing the ability to reconstruct positions among players at different levels, can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://matt.colorado.edu/teaching/highcog/fall8/cs73.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In this study and others that follow, it seems that experts are able to &quot;chunk&quot; concepts in a different way than novices. This can be helpful in situations that rely on one's memory capacity, but is also helpful more generally when clumping together broad ideas that can then be deconstructed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To clarify: I bring up these three items (frogs, birds, chunking) to suggest that students be taught about new objects and some of the related details (frogs), and that more general conceptual explanations (birds) be introduced to unify the objects in a way that allows for better chunking. This allows for mastery to be attained in a domain (here, mathematics).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loose Ends:&lt;/strong&gt; Your &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; is actually four different ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there any good framework for deciding when it is a good idea to &quot;skip the concept&quot; and &quot;just teach the method,&quot; knowing that students will appreciate the concept only much later in life, or possibly never?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you really show children why long division works? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you do, do you intend them to retain that concept? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this skipping-of-the-concept sometimes good and sometimes bad?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope that I have provided helpful thoughts about 1, though I make no remarks here about &lt;em&gt;utility&lt;/em&gt;; this is a needed consideration, but difficult to pin down when you do not know students' future paths. The answers to 2 and 3 are &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;, assuming that the students have sufficient procedural fluency for this concept to be within their ZPD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for 4, skipping a concept can be bad because (as indicated above) it robs students of the opportunity to gain the bird's-eye-view that leads to chunking and, eventually, mastery/expertise. Skipping a concept can be good because, in most cases, an individual item covered can be generalized far beyond what could reasonably be expected in any single course. (Consider an example like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch%27s_Principle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bloch's principle&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a final note, I think a good example of a concept that should be initially skipped is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you can write any rational number in lowest terms. It is true that, for a given rational number, you will be able to do this. However, to assert this for all rational numbers, one will need approximately the strength of the Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI) or the Well-Ordering Principle (WOP). When teaching students (whether in elementary school or a community college developmental mathematics course) about rational numbers and discussing the process of simplification, I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; start talking about PMI or WOP. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2014-04-22T17:45:12.577" LastActivityDate="2014-04-22T17:45:12.577" CommentCount="1" />

Then, once they know what $i$ and $e$ are, and they would generally agree the two constants are unrelated, you can do the magic of plugging in a complex number into the Taylor series for $e^x$ and get the lovely formula. Plug in $i$ and you get the (now beautiful) equation. If you just drop the equation on them, then they will see no beauty in it. It's beauty lies in the relationship it makes between two seemingly unrelated constants. The students need to first think the constants are unrelated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An analogy would be: is it a good idea to present a Weierstrass nowhere differentiable continuous functions as motivations for differential calculus. Well, if the students don't know anything about continuity of differentiability, then they won't find it surprising that Weierstrass functions exist. To be surprised by their existence the students need to first develop the wrong feeling for these concepts, only so that their understanding can be honed by the surprises. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastActivityDate="2014-04-12T20:38:53.283" CommentCount="0" />

Here are a few observations I have about the puzzles I've given in class:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;A good puzzle must be framed very well&lt;/strong&gt;. A puzzle about the sum and product of two integers is (as stated) too boring for all but my most highly motivated students. However, an engaging puzzle has a real world context, a game, an argument, a manipulative, open ended questions (but still structured), etc. I've found that there is relatively little correlation between how interesting I find a puzzle and how interesting my students find it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;A puzzle must attract and keep my weaker students' attention&lt;/strong&gt;. It's relatively easy to gain the attention of my top students (if I just give them a Martin Gardner book they can often occupy themselves with puzzles) but much harder with my weaker students. For them, point (1) is critical, but it's also important for them that I give the puzzle good structure so they don't give up. By that I mean that I try to present puzzles with lots of encouragement, defining terms clearly, providing a simple example and counterexample if possible, and sometimes -- but never before at least a little frustration has set in -- giving one or two good hints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;The serious math discussion is best when it comes with a surprise ending.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, we discussed the U.S. men's college basketball tournament and at the end I demonstrated that the probability of picking 63 games in a row correctly at random is 1 in $2^{63}$.

As most of them were from Bomber Command they were painted black for night-time operations. At the suggestion of CC-ORS a test was run to see if that was the best colour to camouflage the aircraft for daytime operations in the grey North Atlantic skies. Tests showed that aircraft painted white were on average not spotted until they were 20% closer than those painted black. &lt;strong&gt;This change indicated that 30% more submarines would be attacked and sunk for the same number of sightings.[19]&lt;/strong&gt; As a result of these findings Coastal Command changed their aircraft to using white undersurfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A Warwick in the revised RAF Coastal Command green/dark grey/white finish&#xA;  Other work by the CC-ORS indicated that on average if the trigger depth of aerial-delivered depth charges (DCs) were changed from 100 feet to 25 feet, the kill ratios would go up. The reason was that if a U-boat saw an aircraft only shortly before it arrived over the target then at 100 feet the charges would do no damage (because the U-boat wouldn't have had time to descend as far as 100 feet), and if it saw the aircraft a long way from the target it had time to alter course under water so the chances of it being within the 20-foot kill zone of the charges was small. It was more efficient to attack those submarines close to the surface when the targets' locations were better known than to attempt their destruction at greater depths when their positions could only be guessed. &lt;strong&gt;Before the change of settings from 100 feet to 25 feet, 1% of submerged U-boats were sunk and 14% damaged. After the change, 7% were sunk and 11% damaged.&lt;/strong&gt; (If submarines were caught on the surface, even if attacked shortly after submerging, the numbers rose to 11% sunk and 15% damaged).

The differences in the way maths is taught in the two countries is astonishing, yet the outcomes (at least for good students going to good schools) is more or less comparable. Let me highlight two of the most important differences between the two curricula:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The South African curriculum is standardized nationally. There is overall significantly less room in South Africa for textbook writers, schools, or teachers to decide what content should or shouldn't be taught. Though the U.S. is slowly becoming more standardized with the rise of Common Core standards, I suspect that teachers and curriculum organizers in the U.S. still have much more latitude to teach what and how they want than in South Africa&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of South Africa's mathematics education system, however, is their alternate math curriculum called &quot;Mathematical Literacy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maths lit is required through grade 12 for all students not taking the higher grade maths. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Its purpose is to ground students in &quot;life related applications&quot; and &quot;enable learners to develop the ability and confidence to think numerically and spatially in order to interpret and critically analyse everyday situations and to solve problems.&quot; (From p. 19 in the following document: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=25TyZ4RTmKc%3D&amp;amp;tabid=246&amp;amp;mid=594&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=25TyZ4RTmKc%3D&amp;amp;tabid=246&amp;amp;mid=594&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maths lit has been criticized widely in South Africa for not being rigorous enough.

There may be situations where it's possible to apply optimization to solve a problem you've encountered, but in none of these cases is it honestly worth the effort of solving the problem analytically. I optimize path lengths every day when I walk across the grass on my way to classes, but I'm not going to get out a notebook and calculate an optimal route just to save myself twelve seconds of walking every morning. Mathematics beyond basic arithmetic is simply not useful in ordinary life. But I'm not sure if that's exactly what you mean. &amp;ndash; JackM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To some extent, I agree with this comment.  With few exceptions, mathematics beyond basic arithmetic is simply not useful in everyday life.  Students know this, and you'll have trouble convincing them otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I've always found &quot;everyday&quot;-style calculus problems a little artificial.  Consider the following problem from Stewart's &lt;em&gt;Calculus: Concepts and Contexts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A fence 8 ft tall runs parallel to a tall building at a distance of 4 ft from the building.  What is the length of the shortest ladder that will reach from the ground over the fence to the wall of the building?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The proper response to this question is: who cares?  Is there any reason to calculate this length precisely?  Why would anyone ever use calculus to compute this?  If you have an actual building and an actual ladder, you could just try it and see if the ladder fits.  If you don't have a specific ladder in mind (e.g. you are buying a ladder), the thing to do would be to &lt;em&gt;draw&lt;/em&gt; the situation on paper and then use a ruler to estimate the minimum length.  Of course, it's neat that you can use calculus to solve this problem precisely, but this is more of a curiosity than a legitimate application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chris specifically mentions the farmer fence problem, the wire-cutting problem, and the Norman window problem as not relevant to the students' lives.  I agree&amp;mdash;none of these problems are relevant.  But it's not because the students aren't farmers, or wire-cutters, or architects.  Even in a class full of future farmers, the fence problem would still be bad, because &lt;em&gt;farmers don't use calculus to plan their fences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Good Optimization Problems&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What calculus &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; useful for is science, economics, engineering, industrial operations, finance, and so forth.  That is, it's useful for &lt;em&gt;all the things that make our society run&lt;/em&gt;.  Most students who take calculus at a university are planning to go into one of these fields, so calculus will be relevant in their lives&amp;mdash;specifically in their future studies and in their professions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's something that's closer to a real-life optimization problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When a critically damped RLC circuit is connected to a voltage source, the current $I$ in the circuit varies with time according to the equation&#xA;  $$&#xA;I \;=\; \biggl(\frac{V}{L}\biggr)te^{-Rt/(2L)}&#xA;$$&#xA;  where $V$ is the applied voltage, $L$ is the inductance, and $R$ is the resistance (all of which are constant).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Suppose an RLC circuit with a resistance of 30.0&amp;nbsp;volt/amp and an inductance of 0.400&amp;nbsp;volt&amp;middot;sec/amp is attached to a 12.0-volt voltage source.  Find the maximum current that will occur in the circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is at least close to something that a physics or engineering student might actually come across in their future studies.  It's real in a way that the farmer fence problem isn't, and even students who don't plan to study physics can sense that this is a legitimate application.  (By the way, if you have good students, you might even ask them to come up with a formula for the maximum current, without giving them specific numbers for $V$, $L$ and $R$.  This has the advantage that it can't simply be solved using a graphing calculator.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this isn't actually a &lt;em&gt;constrained&lt;/em&gt; optimization problem&amp;mdash;it's just an optimization problem.  I'm not actually aware of any place in science that simple constrained optimization problems arise, although there are examples from economics (maximizing utility), finance (optimal portfolios), and industrial design (e.g. shape of a can type problems).  When I cover constrained optimization in calculus, I usually stick to industrial-type problems (best cans, best shipping crates/boxes, best pipeline across a river, etc.), but that's probably just because I don't know enough about economics or finance to make up problems that involve them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I should mention that I've never found the optimization portion of Calculus I particularly compelling.  It's good to introduce the idea of optimization, but setting the derivative equal to zero isn't actually a very useful optimization technique by itself.  It only really works for simple formulas&amp;mdash;for anything complicated it just replaces one essentially numerical problem (finding the maximum of a function) with another (finding roots of a function).  I agree that it should be covered, but it's far from the most important application of calculus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastEditorUserId="50" LastEditDate="2014-04-13T02:50:05.523" LastActivityDate="2014-04-13T02:50:05.523" CommentCount="1" />

Plato is difficult in that he does not tell you the answers; Socrates is Plato's character and not his voice, which makes distinguishing what Plato means from what Socrates says a problem for the reader to ponder; Socrates is meant to provoke the reader and not to instruct the reader.  So please forgive me for anticipating some resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The works particularly related to education are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meno&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politeia&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The Republic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Meno&lt;/em&gt; is centrally about whether virtue can taught or learned, and it goes into some depth about what is to know and to learn and how to learn.  It has the controversial scene in which Socrates leads Meno's uneducated servant to discover for himself the solution of the geometry problem of how to duplicate a square. The &lt;em&gt;Theatetus&lt;/em&gt; is about knowledge in which Socrates converses with two mathematicians.  &lt;em&gt;Politeia&lt;/em&gt; is famous, of course; it is a broad ranging book centrally about justice and the ideal state for achieving justice.  It is famous for its description of the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment in terms of the myth of the Cave and its literal interpretation of what we still call &quot;reflection.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of Plato's principles which I infer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is an innate capacity of human beings to learn and even to discover.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Humans are rational and can think.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Humans naturally like to learn; to really know that you do not know something means to recognize a gap that needs filling.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learning requires being shown, trying things, discussing them, practice, and repetition with variation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learning is difficult, but if the learner keeps trying and does not give up, the learner will succeed.  (The presumption is that there is something to know, that we're not trying to solve an unsolvable problem.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learning is best done with others.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In learning we seek the truth, not someone's (favored) opinion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learning is based on prior knowledge.  (There is some evidence that Plato held this, but perhaps not overwhelming evidence, afaik.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Telling the student what to repeat and the student memorizing it is neither teaching nor learning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most or all of these principles are upheld, I think, by our current scientific understanding.  Our rationality is perhaps more nuanced now, and one can make an argument that our understanding of it is significantly different than Plato's.  The emotional and rational cannot be completely separated in the way the brain operates.  On the other hand, I do know my students can think.  I am always reminded of this principle whenever I hear someone say they want to teach students how to think.  There is a danger there of telling the students &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; to think.  I can usually tell what the person means and can see that the danger is avoided.  But not always.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the importance placed on discussion.  Implicit in it is that anyone might be your teacher.

Trust me, spending 30 minutes out of a two-hour lecture watching the lecturer look for a sign error they made 15 minutes earlier gets old &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that any lecture time you spend backtracking and correcting errors is time you &lt;em&gt;could've&lt;/em&gt; spent teaching the students something new.  I've never heard of a lecturer complaining about having &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; time to cover everything they'd like, so good lecturers usually need to carefully budget their time, and any time spent finding and fixing mistakes in front of the class takes time out of this budget that has to be made up somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, while &lt;em&gt;showing&lt;/em&gt; your students a carefully planned example of how a mathematician would really approach a new problem can be very educational, that's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same as just having the students twiddle their thumbs while you stare at the blackboard in confusion, which is what's more likely to happen if you &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; get stuck in the middle of a proof.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, here's a few ideas you could try, if you think your lectures are too polished and would benefit from more mistakes and spontaneity:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fake it:&lt;/strong&gt; Prepare your lectures as carefully as you can, but make occasional deliberate mistakes when writing on the blackboard.  (You could even write something like &quot;make mistake here&quot; in your notes.)  Encourage your students to try and spot these mistakes (with small rewards, if necessary).  If they &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; spot them in a few minutes, pretend to notice them yourself and fix them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this also helps encourage your students to spot any &lt;em&gt;genuine&lt;/em&gt; mistakes you might make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it an event:&lt;/strong&gt; Pick a specific problem that you're fairly sure you can solve on the spot, and allocate some extra time for it.  Make sure to tell your students that you haven't prepared notes for that specific proof in advance &amp;mdash; this also has the useful effect of helping your students realize that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; normally prepare your proofs in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to keep describing what you're thinking while solving the problem out loud, and encourage your students to offer suggestions if you get stuck.  Optionally, prepare a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; in case you really do get stuck, or pick the problem so that you can leave completing the proof as a bonus exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act it out:&lt;/strong&gt; Same as above, but actually have a plan for your &quot;spontaneous&quot; proof.  That is, when preparing the lecture, prove the theorem in advance, but write down not just the final &quot;tidy&quot; solution, but also a log of any mistakes and dead ends you encounter.  Then re-enact the full proof, dead ends and all, in front of the class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't feel like actually re-enacting your solving process in every detail, you can still include some deliberate dead ends in your lecture plan.  For example, once you've shown how to prove the stability of a stable node using phase-plane analysis, try doing it for a stable focus instead.  Or pick a pumpable non-regular language and try to prove its nonregularity using the pumping lemma, before giving up and using Myhill&amp;ndash;Nerode instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, even if you don't feel like using any such tricks, one thing you can do to make your usual &quot;tidy&quot; proofs seem a bit less linear is to sprinkle them with details about possible dead ends (&quot;The obvious way to try and prove this would be to use lemma 1, but that doesn't work here, because...&quot;) or historical notes (&quot;The original proof of this theorem was 50 pages long; the short proof I'll show you was only found 38 years later by...&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="526" LastActivityDate="2014-04-13T17:14:24.603" CommentCount="4" />

Students could come in and ask us questions about a fairly long list of standard introductory courses (we each wore badges indicating which courses we were (hopefully) competent to help with).  I was terrified to do this at first, because I figured I'd be asked to help with lots of problems I wouldn't remember how to do (having actually been in that class in 2-3 years prior, and not everything sticks or gets built on).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we tutors ended up doing most of the time was doing a lot of what you suggest -- winging it obviously, but in the process showing how to go about figuring out a tough math problem.  So we'd ask them what they'd learned about in class that week (often a good clue as to what theorems might be being exercised) and basically had them get out their textbooks and we'd look through the section they were in to find something relevant to the problem.  And yes, sometimes we'd get a student started on an approach that seemed like it would work but ended up not working out. And sometimes we had to call over another tutor to help us figure things out.  At first I felt really bad about having to do that instead of just &quot;knowing&quot; what to tell them, but eventually I realized that we were modeling the type of thinking and problem solving they'd need to learn to do to be able to solve the problems on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to your question:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the interest of time, I wouldn't suggest lecturers come to class unprepared.  However, I would suggest that maybe your preparation consist of &quot;winging it&quot; in advance, and keeping track of your approach, your wild goose chases, etc. and presenting a somewhat cleaned up summary of &quot;how I solved this problem&quot; in lecture.   You can share some of your wrong turns, maybe in the context of, &quot;at first I thought I could try X -- can anyone see why that wouldn't work?&quot; (and if necessary give a quick summary of why that didn't work).  That mitigates the issue of you wasting too much time on unproductive asides, while still helping them see what kinds of things you thought about when trying to solve the problem (or prove the theorem, or whatever you're demonstrating).  And it saves the problem for students about notes being unintelligible because you can announce in advance that you're going to go off on an unproductive tangent, when you choose to do so for illustrative purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="817" LastActivityDate="2014-04-13T21:11:01.393" CommentCount="0" />

I think Ilmari Karonen's answer is closest to my own heart.  For now let me just respond to one aspect of the question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have heard the story (may be an urban legend?) of a top professor who occasionally wanted to teach freshman analysis.  He believed in the method of letting students see how a mathematician's mind works, so he came to the lectures largely unprepared, and was proving theorems as they were met in the textbook. Consequently he would not always follow the straightest path to the destination. Occasionally he ran afoul full speed, and had to backtrack a bit or even start over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find this &quot;top professor&quot;'s teaching practice obnoxious.  That's a matter of opinion, but the proposed justification contains (perhaps intentionally!!) several points which I find fallacious.  Namely:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\bullet$ I believe in letting my students see how a mathematician's mind works too.  But whenever a mathematician is involved in teaching a course, one sees, in one way or another, how a mathematician's mind works.  The idea that under-preparation gives a truer view to the mathematician's mind is ridiculous.  Much of what a mathematician does is to think things out in advance and take advantage of what she has figured out.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\bullet$ &quot;...and were proving the theorems largely as they were met in the textbook&quot;  Already a problem: in closely following a textbook students are -- at best -- seeing how the textbook author's mind works, not the instructor's.  In a course which consists primarily of theorems and proofs (I wonder in what land &quot;freshman analysis&quot; is such a course; it is not the United States, certainly; we rarely teach analysis in any form to freshmen), strictly adhering to the logical sequence of the textbook turns the lecture into a dramatic reading of the textbook.  This is so much less than what an instructor should be doing in class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\bullet$ Running afoul at full speed and having to backtrack or start over entirely are reasonable classroom events.  To see them happen at least once in a given course is probably a good thing: I have heard students react surprisingly (to me) positively when this sort of thing happens in my own courses.  But as others have pointed out, when it happens once or twice it is heartening.  When it causes an entire lecture to become derailed and then repeated the next time without a fatal sign mistake, it is clearly not good use of class time, and it will be frustrating to students.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other fallacy here is that one needs to take such a completely derelict &quot;let it all hang out&quot; lecturing attitude in order for such mistakes to occur in the lecture.  I have been teaching for many years, and I still make mistakes in my calculus lectures, let alone in graduate courses in which I am presenting the material for the first time.  A certain positive rate of errors seems all but inevitable: if I asked you to prepare complete lecture notes, got a team of experts to check them over, gave them back to you and repeated until we were satisfied that they are seamlessly correct and complete, and then allowed you to bring the notes into the lecture and give a lecture which consisted purely of writing the notes on the board, then you will still make errors a positive percentage of the time.  (In fact, as one learns, there is an interior maximum for this with respect to preparation: if you prepare too much then you stop thinking about what you're doing, and that makes errors more likely to occur.)  The idea that one needs to make sure to be unprepared so as to get a desirable density of errors is really risible to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me close by saying that the pedagogical practice of &lt;strong&gt;intentional mistakes&lt;/strong&gt; is a good one, and I have used it myself: if I want to introduce a subtle point in an advanced course, I will often introduce it by doing an example or a computation in which this subtle point is ignored and a contradiction is reached.  I think this is an excellent example of a &quot;mathematician's mind at work&quot;.  The difference is that I have nevertheless prepared this in advance and the mistake is intentional.  (At least, the intended mistake is intentional! I remember that earlier this semester I gave an argument in which I warned in advance that I was going to make a mistake in the proof.  After the lecture was over, someone came to me and pointed out that I seemed to assume what I wanted to prove.  I smacked myself in the head and wondered how I could have done something so terrible.

However, there are reasons that this approach is problematic for instruction. I have a research reference, and an anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Smith, diSessa, and Roschelle (1993) discussed some of what had been accomplished with understanding student learning using the model of misconceptions, and then gave some critique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the section &quot;Is Confrontation an Appropriate Model of Classroom &#xA;Learning?&quot; p. 126, they wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There are both strengths and weaknesses in this conceptualization of&#xA;  classroom instruction. We need energetic classroom discussions in&#xA;  which students take positions, make sense of and explain problematic&#xA;  phenomena, and articulate justifications for their ideas. Activities&#xA;  that produce states of cognitive conflict are certainly desirable and&#xA;  conducive to conceptual change. However, as judged by constructivist&#xA;  standards, confrontation suffers from important deficits as either a&#xA;  phase of conceptual change or a model of instruction. As cognitive&#xA;  competition, it cannot explain why expert ideas win out over&#xA;  misconceptions. The rational replacement of one conception with&#xA;  another requires criteria for judgment. As knowledge, those criteria&#xA;  must be constructed by the learner, and neither confrontation nor&#xA;  replacement explains the origins of such principles for choosing&#xA;  concepts, crucial data, or theories. In fact, change in how one&#xA;  decides in favor of one conception over another is a complex part of&#xA;  conceptual development (Kuhn &amp;amp; Phelps, 1982; Schauble, 1990), and&#xA;  confrontation is an implausible mechanism for changing principles that&#xA;  decide, for example, the relevance of data to theory. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Confrontation is also problematic as an instructional model. In&#xA;  contrast to more evenhanded approaches to classroom discussions in&#xA;  which students are encouraged to evaluate their conceptions relative&#xA;  to the complexity of the phenomena or problem, confrontation&#xA;  essentially denies the validity of students' ideas. It communicates to&#xA;  students that their specific conceptions and their general efforts to&#xA;  understand are fundamentally flawed. The metaphor of confrontation is&#xA;  also inconsistent with the pedagogical sensitivity and care required&#xA;  to negotiate new understandings in the classroom (Yaekel, Cobb, &amp;amp;&#xA;  Wood, 1991). Finally, some misconceptions are powerful enough to&#xA;  influence what students actually perceive, thereby decreasing the&#xA;  chances that planned confrontation and competition will be successful&#xA;  (Resnick, 1983).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My anecdote (much abbreviated): A few years ago I was assisting a teacher in a 4th grade class by helping two students who were having difficulty comparing fractions. They thought 3/4 was greater than 4/5. A number of ways of approaching this occurred to me, and to keep the story short, I will just say that I had them construct a physical model that you and I would likely agree showed that 4/5 is greater than 3/4. However, as time ran out on us, they looked at their work and said, &quot;yes, see? 3/4 is more than 4/5.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure you could find things to critique in the details of my approach. But two things struck me later as a was driving home. The first was that sometimes seeing depends on what you are sure you know. But the second is even more relevant: I still did not know much about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; those students thought 3/4 was greater than 4/5. Spending all my time trying to help them reach a productive state of confrontation, I didn't learn about what they knew. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When students know something, it represents knowledge that somehow made some sense to them in some other context. But it's not working appropriately in the desired context. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is research showing that a focus on student student conceptions, rather than mistakes, is not only productive for student learning, it also can be a helpful model in preparing teachers for thinking about student thinking (Fennema et al., 1996).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, these conceptions students have are tied to specific content knowledge. Therefore, a taxonomy of mistakes (de-contextualized from specific content) may not necessarily be useful in the action of classroom instruction. Certainly useful is knowing with some accuracy the types of ways students come into the class making sense of the content in a way that is limiting them (yet it makes some sense to them). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cited:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uta.edu/faculty/tjorgens/pastcourses/WNO/jrme.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fennema, E., Carpenter, T.

It sounds like overkill, but in my experience part of the reason students don't attend office hours is because it's just not a salient option to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also find that attendance is much higher before an assignment or test. If there's a weekly assignment due on Friday, say, choosing to hold your office hours on Wednesday or Thursday will probably result in higher attendance than holding them on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, some students don't attend office hours because they're embarrassed. This is the main reason why &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; typically didn't attend office hours as an undergraduate (a fact I regret to this day). Although in office hours the students don't have to contend with feeling stupid in front of too many of their peers, they are, on the other hand, less able to &quot;melt into the crowd&quot;. A lot of students feel that to attend office hours they have to have &quot;good&quot; questions prepared, so if they're too confused or have fallen too far behind, they won't go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to counteract this? I try to be as open and explicit about it as possible. I say things to the class like, &quot;If you're so confused you don't even know what question to ask, then office hours are for you. Chances are you're not alone,&quot; or, &quot;You don't have to come to office hours with specific question; you can just come and tell me you're confused about a particular section.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, depending on your grading scheme, the following can be a very effective inducement to attend office hours: I will work through and explicitly solve homework questions in office hours. More precisely, I work through specific questions that I'm asked to on the board, with involvement from the students, regardless of whether they're on the homework or not. Thus, students who attend office hours will almost certainly do better on the homework. I don't mind doing this because I view the assigned homework as an inducement to practice more than a way of assessing skill, and if students put in the time during office hours, that ought to count as practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="327" LastActivityDate="2014-04-14T17:26:25.500" CommentCount="3" />

Note that these are as true of professional mathematics as mathematics education, at least occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formalism; or, the belief that a rigorous style is necessarily rigorous mathematics, or even correct, or even intuitively valid.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Of course, style cannot save a bad argument.  Furthermore, it might not rescue it from implicit omissions, such as, for example, &quot;A triangle is the union of three lines&quot;, despite using a precise concept such as &quot;union&quot;.  The idea might not even be reasonable, like, say, &quot;Let $x$ be the smallest positive real number&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platonism; or, the belief that an appeal to the intuitive essence of an idea is sufficient replacement for rigor, or even correct, or even universally understood.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Famously, intuition in calculus cannot always be made rigorous, such as the original definitions of Newton and Leibniz in terms of infinitesimals (they are not to be blamed much, as rigor was different then).  At least these could be rescued, unlike &quot;proofs&quot; of the parallel postulate that rejected the consequences of what turned out to be non-Euclidean geometry as being contrary to the concept of a line.  Similarly to the first, the definition of continuity &quot;$f(x) - f(a)$ is small&quot; can mean almost anything you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luddism; or, the rejection of mathematical &quot;technology&quot;, i.e. refined methods.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Students often insist that what they think they know is more reliable than what they are taught.  Even researchers may feel that an elementary technique they can get away with using is preferable to one that is specifically appropriate, but theoretically more difficult.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of English; or, stringing a complex concept together with words alone, rather than encapsulating its ideas precisely and referring to them with jargon.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;This can be as basic as the antique style &quot;The sum of twice something with an additional quantity of three has the total amount of five, and therefore that thing is itself unity&quot;.  In the now-rare Euclidean geometry proof class, you see phrases like &quot;corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent&quot; used as a mantra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misuse of symbols; or, stringing a complex deduction together without any words at all.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Parse this: &quot;$f(x) = x + \sin(x) = f'(x) = 1 + \cos(x) = 0 = \cos(x) = -1 = x = n \pi \text{ ($n$ odd)}$&quot;.  There are three related computations in there, plus the use of one theorem (on critical points) and a classification of trig function values, which should all be separated.  I have heard this described as &quot;knowing only 'equals' as a mathematical verb&quot;.  Actually, I hope that this is never seen in professional math.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearsightedness; or, not following your nose; or, getting stuck because the next step looks like it is necessarily hard.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Any problem where, say, one suddenly has to solve a system of several linear equations.  Tedious, yes, but there is a straightforward procedure and it must be done, or if not, finding the alternative is possibly even more work.  Numerous exams have been submitted where the solution ends at just such a spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farsightedness; or, not simplifying the question because it looks too hard as a whole.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;I knew of a professor who would answer most questions with &quot;Use the definition!&quot;.  If it weren't for this fallacy, no one would ever have trouble with set-theory exercises like &quot;$f^{-1}(A \cap B) = f^{-1}(A) \cap f^{-1}(B)$&quot;.  Tim Gowers and Mohan Ganesalingam have written a program designed to solve this kind of problem, in part, by not making this mistake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not generalizing; or, doing exercises without getting any better at doing non-exercises.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Every semester I have students who ask me after exams how they could study better even though they do all the exercises, sometimes even more than I ask.

My office isn't nearly large enough to accommodate 10 students, and students who have to wait outside don't feel welcome.  By reserving a classroom or other large room, I make sure there's enough space for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go at least two hours at a time.

The more office hours you have, the more likely it is that students will be able to make it to one of them.  I try to have at least 5 office hours a week, with an average of 7 or 8 when I'm teaching three classes.  In some semesters, my office hours have been so full that I've gone up to 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schedule your office hours for times that the students will find convenient.  At my college, this means either the evenings or on Fridays.  In addition, it's very important to schedule office hours for right when the students want to be working, i.e. the day before homework is due, or the day before a quiz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the students perceive office hours as helpful.  Every student who attends office hours must feel like they got some noticeable help with the homework assignment.  In many cases, this means that you have to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;give significant help with homework problems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  Of course, talking with you about the course material is one of the best things a student can do, but students may not perceive the value in this, so the only way to make sure that they keep coming back is to give them hints, check over their answers, and do other tangible things to help them complete the homework assignments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announce your office hours every day in class.

Say that we want to compute $46^2$. We use $46^2 = (40+6)^2 = 40^2+2\cdot40\cdot6 +6^2 = 1600 + 480 + 36 = 2116$. You can also use this method for negative $b$:&#xA;$ 197^2 = (200 - 3)^2 = 200^2 - 2\cdot200\cdot3 + 3^2 = 40000 - 1200 + 9 = 38809 $&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last subtraction can be kind of tricky: remember to do it right to left, and take out the common multiples of 10:&#xA;$ 40000 - 1200 = 100(400-12) = 100(398-10) = 100(388) = 38800 $&#xA;The hardest thing here is to keep track of the amount of zeroes, this takes some practice!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that if we're computing $(a+b)^2$ and a is a multiple of $10^k$ and $b$ is a single digit-number, we already know the last $k$ digits of the answer: they are $b^2$, then the rest (going to the right) are zeroes. We can use this even if a is only a multiple of 10: the last digit of $(10 * a + b)^2$ (where $a$ and $b$ consist of a single digit) is $b$. So we can write (or maybe only make a mental note that we have the final digit) that down and worry about the more significant digits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also useful for things like $46\cdot47 = 46^2 + 46 = 2116 + 46 = 2162$. When both numbers are even or both numbers are uneven, you might want to use:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$&#xA;Say, for example, we want to compute $23 \cdot 27$. We can write this as $(25 - 2)(25 + 2) = 25^2 - 2^2 = (20 + 5)^2 = 20^2 + 2\cdot20\cdot5 + 5^2 - 4 = 400 + 200 + 25 - 4 = 621$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Divisability checks&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Already covered by Theodore Norvell.

I don't really remember everything and there probably are a more cool things in the book, but I remember with algorithm for multiplication that you can use to multiplicate numbers in your head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/orCcx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gelosia or lattice multiplication&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This picture shows a method called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_multiplication&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lattice or gelosia multiplication&lt;/a&gt; and is just a way of writing our good old-fashioned multiplication algorithm (the one we use on paper) in a nice way. Please notice that the picture and the Vedic algorithm are not tied: I added the picture because I think it helps you appreciate and understand the pattern that is used in the algorithm. The gelosia notation shows this in a much nicer way than the traditional notation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm the guy explained is essentially the same algorithm as we would use on paper. However, it structures the arithmetic in such a way that we never have remember too many numbers at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's illustrate the method by multiplying 456 with 128, as in the picture. We work from left to right: we first compute the least significant digits and work our way up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We start by multiplying the least significant digits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$4 \cdot 8 = 48$: the least significant digit is $8$, remember the $4(0)$ for the next round (of course, I don't mean zero times four here but four, or forty, whatevery you prefer: be consistent though, if you include the zero here to make forty, you got do it everywhere).&#xA;$ 8 \cdot 5(0) = 40(0) $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ 2(0) \cdot 6 = 12(0) $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ 4(0) + 40(0) + 12(0) = 56(0) $: our next digit (to the left of the $8$) is $6$: remember the $5(00)$ &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$ 8 \cdot 4(00) = 32(00) $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ 2(0) \cdot 5(0) = 10(00) $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ 1(00) \cdot 6 = 6(00) $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ 5(00) + 32(00) + 10(00) + 6(00) = 53(00) $: our next digit is a $3$, remember the $5(000)$ &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pfff... starting with 2-digit numbers is a better idea, but I wanted to this longer one to make the structure of the algorithm clear. You can do this much faster if you have practiced, since you don't have to write it all down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$ 2(0) \cdot 4(00) = 8(000) $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ 1(00) \cdot 5(0) = 5(000)$ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ 5(000) + 8(000) + 5(000) = 18(000)$: next digit is an $8$, remember the $1(0000)$&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$ 1(00) \cdot 4(00) = 4(0000) $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ 1(0000) + 4(0000) = 5(0000) $: the most significant digit is a $5$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we have 58368.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Quadratic equations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to solve a quadratic equation in your head. The easiest are quadratic with integer coefficients. If we have $x^2 + ax + c = 0$, try to find $r_{1, 2}$ such that $r_1 + r_2 = -a$ and $r_1r_2 = c$. It is also possible to solve for non-integer solutions this way, but it is usually too hard to actually come up with solutions this way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way is just to try divisors of the constant term. By the rational root theorem (google it, I can't link anymore &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;) all solutions to $x^n + ... + c = 0$ need to be divisors of $c$. If $c$ is a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, the solutions need to be of the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ divides $p$ and $b$ divides $q$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this all fails, we can still put the abc-formula in a much easier form:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$ ux^2 + vx + w = 0 $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ x^2 + \frac{v}{u}x + \frac{w}{u} = 0 $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ x^2 + \frac{v}{u}x + \frac{w}{u} = 0 $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ x^2 - ax - b = 0 $&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$ x^2 = ax + b $ &lt;strong&gt;(This is the form that I found easiest to use!)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ (x - \frac{a}{2})^2 = (\frac{a}{2})^2 + b $ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;$ x = \frac{a\pm\sqrt{a^2 + 4b}}{2} = \frac{a}{2} \pm \sqrt{(\frac{a}{2})^2 + b} $&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are also a lot of techniques for estimating products and the like, but I'm not really familiar with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Tricks that aren't really usable but still pretty cool&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8acoaakvPM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from Feynman's &quot;Surely you're joking, mr.

We say:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;a function is continuous if it is continuous on its domain. Moreover, this means $f(x) \rightarrow f(a)$ as $x \rightarrow a^{\pm}$.

Of course, you do need to lift your pencil to graph $y=1/x$. So, how can we reconcile this? Frankly, we can't. The previous course was in error. That said, I try to smooth things out by emphasizing that when we restrict the focus to &lt;strong&gt;connected domains&lt;/strong&gt; aka &lt;strong&gt;intervals&lt;/strong&gt; then their intuition is restored.

This is intuitive, but, this is not how we carefully work with functions $f:A \rightarrow B$. The points where $f$ is not defined are not taken away, there not even there at the outset. I face this issue with both eyes open and don't shy away from it in calculus because I want students to pay more mind to the idea that a function is not just a formula.

It is easy to forget that and it is partly our job as educators to explain this from time to time to the students (least they start thinking mathematics is a static discipline). So, such situations were students show a distrust in a particular definition that we know is a really good one is an excellent opportunity to engage the students with the dynamic nature of mathematics. I usually encourage the students then to scrutinize the definition, making their objections explicit. Depending on how much time I wish to spend on such things I then decide whether or not to look into their objections more carefully or not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you handle this situation?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two particular difficulties you mention I would treat as follows. Difficulties on whether or not $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ is continuous are the result of being careless with specifying the domain. This is thus an excellent opportunity to explain that the question &quot;is $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ is continuous&quot; is meaningless until one specifies the domain. If there are some books that fail to do this properly, then it's a good opportunity to warn the students of lousy books. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second situation, that of vacuous situations, can indeed be quite confusing but I would not spend too much time on it since such things rarely show up in nature. Moreover, once students are a bit more proficient with mathematical arguments they will easy dispense with such trivialities themselves, so the problem solves itself. If students are really troubled by this I would tell them to spend 15 minutes thinking about it and resolve it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can I do better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, if one can not longer improve, then one is dead, so yes, you can also do better :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The particular notion of continuity is actually a very tricky one, at least historically. Our intuition for what continuity means is quite bad. It is common to say that a function is continuous if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper. This is wrong of course, as it more accurately describes functions that are infinitely differentiable at all but finitely many points. It is actually quite difficult to geometrically understand continuous functions. This is something the students should be able to relate to - after all it is difficult for them to understand this concept. Also, historically, mathematicians struggled long and hard with this concepts with many disagreements between Lagrange, Cauchy, Bolazano, and Weierstrass. Some of these historical accounts can also be conveyed to the students. It can also be mentioned that the standard Cauchy definition is not the only way to formalize the notion of continuity, just to tell the students that more than one road exists. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="59" LastActivityDate="2014-04-16T02:02:56.707" CommentCount="0" />

The issue here is that the true or false answer is more of a subtle trick, namely, noting that a trivial group of order 1 is cylic, but that 1 is not prime; so the correct answer is &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is, I think, a pretty good example of a true or false question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True or false:&lt;/strong&gt; Every nontrivial cyclic group of prime order is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for some prime $p$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, this could make for a nice iff proof; however, my sense is that this is a fact that students should know cold, and, while the proof can be made pretty succinct, writing out all the details during a timed examination seems to me like more trouble than it is worth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is another bad example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True or false:&lt;/strong&gt; For every finite group $G$, if every subgroup is normal, then $G$ is abelian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is bad because it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like it is probably false, but actually dreaming up the counterexample is not so straightforward unless it has been given some thought beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A better question might be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Classify (without justification) all groups up to isomorphism for orders 1 through 7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Give an example (without justification) of an 8 element nonabelian group $G$ with every subgroup normal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; Identify two nontrivial and non-isomorphic proper subgroups of $G$; prove they are not isomorphic, and then prove that each is a normal subgroup of $G$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, parts &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; are both quick and not too tough to guess, though writing out the details (e.g., of why there are only two groups of order 6) is a bit of a hassle.

For example, imagine when the first few countries were switching to the metric system, I'm sure exactly the same arguments were used.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is part of EuYu's answer, but with $\tau$ and $\pi$ replaced with &quot;the metric system of units&quot; and &quot;the British system&quot;, respectively:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I feel that it is perhaps a little irresponsible to teach the metric system of units instead of British units. As a first introduction, it is the norm which should be taught: teaching a rare alternative to the British units only serves to confuse students, especially when almost all available resources use British units instead of metric units. Imagine a student's confusion when they see meters in class and feet everywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Thinking long-term&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the arguments for the status-quo have seemed a bit short-sighted. Many changes have a switching cost, but pay perpetual benefits after the switch is over, as in switching to metric units.  I think we should be asking ourselves: &quot;Do we really want to be using a didactally and intuively inferior circle constant for the next 500 years?&quot; instead of &quot;Do we want to have to rewrite our textbooks?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yes, textbooks would need to be rewritten, but textbooks get updated all the time with new, modern notation.  This is a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yes, &quot;the students would not be able to read older literature&quot; as Markus Klein points out in his answer.  True, but when I read a very old journal paper, I already have a hard time.  Again, it's because notation changes, usually for the better.  I'm glad that people are no longer using the same exact math/physics notation that was used 100 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Educators can make this change happen&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more people would agree to switch to $\tau$ if everyone were to do it at once - say, starting in 2015, all professors, all publishers, all researchers, etc. would switch to $\tau$ in one fell swoop.  I'm down with that, but that's not going to happen if I've understood human nature correctly.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has to start somewhere and educators are the gatekeepers of knowledge - educators teach the youngsters and write the textbooks.  If the change is going to happen, it will happen thanks to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;My Personal experience of teaching with $\tau$&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm the TA for a Math Methods for Physics course at an American univeristy, and I use $\tau$ in my discussions.

I established a &lt;em&gt;absolute due time&lt;/em&gt;, which typically was that it should be there before I get to my office and check mail the next morning. I warned them that I sometimes got to work very early (5:00 a.m. or earlier), and sometimes not until after 7:00 a.m., so to not take any chances, they should essentially regard the absolute deadline as the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, as much as possible (these being departmental or course supervisor constraints), I tried to avoid actually taking up and grading homework as much as possible. Instead, I found it much simpler to have frequent short (5 to 15 minutes) quizzes, averaging at least one quiz per week for the semester, and sometimes averaging nearly two quizzes, these averages being for classes that meet 2 or 3 times a week. &lt;em&gt;Sometimes&lt;/em&gt; the quizzes were what others call &quot;homework quizzes&quot; (students get to use their homework on the quiz), but I would instead just make it an open notes quiz. I did this because I did not want to go around to every desk and police whether they were really using their homework (and not class notes), especially when a lot of students did their homework in the same spiral bound notebook they took class notes in. And yes, I realize that some students used photocopies of other students' notes and homework, but I didn't police that either. The only thing I did try to police in these situations was to make sure that they didn't pass notes to each other. You have to watch carefully for this, because once a note is passed and received, you have no way of telling (without careful scrutiny of all the papers on a student's desk) whether a certain student may have gotten worked quiz solutions from a nearby student.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="745" LastActivityDate="2014-04-16T15:21:08.600" CommentCount="5" />

My way of dealing with it is to say that if you turn in your homework on time you can resubmit before the end of the semester to raise your grade for half credit.  So if I give out a ten problem set, and a student turns in five problems that are 100% correct that's still 50%, F.  Three weeks later the student can come in with the remaining five problems.  Assuming they're 100% correct, minus 50% late penalty = 75% or C, but still better than an F.  Of course if the student turns in nothing at the due date then the student gets zero. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imparts a sense of understanding the importance of meeting deadlines while allowing for some flexibility.  I know that some students save up for the week of Spring Break to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm also flexible on before-the-fact excuses.

Having electronic submissions cuts down on physical stuff happening, like missing the bus, that would prevent timely submission. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last semester I experimented with having students use Dropbox folders to hold all their work and then sharing the folder with me. As they worked, they kept their works-in-progress in the Dropbox folder. Once they were done, they just added the word FINAL to the file name so I would know what to grade. This way they never &quot;turned in&quot; homework -- all the versions of the work were in the Dropbox folder at all times, and they didn't have to &quot;remember&quot; to turn something in. I've been doing the same thing with SageMath Cloud this semester with my discrete structures students. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you use paper submissions, then tell students that if they are prevented from being physically present to submit their work on paper, they can (and should) scan it with their phones and send it to you. Not every student has a smart phone, but most do. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR -- &quot;Late homework gets a 0&quot; is a perfectly fine policy to have as long as you give students multiple avenues of submitting work. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="942" LastActivityDate="2014-04-16T18:35:12.323" CommentCount="2" />

In quotation marks because really, it all comes down to, &quot;I have n points, and need to find a [linear/exponential/whatever] function that crosses these n points&quot;. This is particularly something I find useful during development of software with graphical interfaces. Especially games, but really, anything with moving objects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And of course, if you're doing anything in 3D, Linear Algebra is soooo useful! Learning how to view matrices as linear transformations (functions) with the stuff you normally learn about in algebra and calc. Like the fact that matrices can be injective, surjective, and have domains and ranges. And learning about eigenvalues and -vectors, and how they can be visualized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, discrete math is super important. Learning how to apply combinatorics and create and improve algorithms with decreased complexity has been a godsend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="796" LastActivityDate="2014-04-16T18:57:27.680" CommentCount="2" />

Graph theory (esp. trees and graph search), set theory, and formal logic (mostly propositional or first order) are backbones of programming. Going deeper, automata theory is important as well, but not as integral. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, it's likely that these topics are covered in the CS department already. If it's not, they're excellent candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that's important is asympototic analysis, mostly in the form of Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta. Again, this is usually introduced in a required CS course, but not necessarily. This is important enough to know that it tends to come up on interviews for software engineering positions. The ability to find the asymptotic behavior of recursive functions is also important, and less taught than the ability to do it for iterative processes (which are often trivially converted into polynomials). Obviously you only need to focus on more trivial recursive functions, proving a function's asymptotic behavior can be legitimately difficult and is very expansive, but single-variable recursion that can be solved with the &quot;find the pattern&quot; variety of problem solving is pretty good to teach. Finding the behavior of stuff like $M(1)=1;$ $M(n) = M(\lfloor\frac{1}{2}n\rfloor) + M(\lceil\frac{1}{2}n\rceil) + 2n + c;$ $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{1+};c\in \mathbb{Z}^{0+}$ can be immensely useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you start getting into the nitty gritty: statistics, regression, calculus, probability, and such are all very important, but only to certain subfields or people planning on going deeper into &quot;CS&quot; territory than &quot;programming the front page of a comedy website&quot;. Being able to work with big data tends to require a lot of probability calculus (as does any machine learning). These skills are very in demand right now, but I'm not sure if you can cover enough to give the foundation in a single survey course. I mean, you're just plain not going to get to meaningfully explain gradients to anyone if you're going for reasonable breadth and replacing basic calculus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise linear algebra, which is important in computer graphics and computational geometry. You can find a good survey of the kind of math used in graphics by looking at any good &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Open GL tutorial, here's one for reference&lt;/a&gt;. It's mostly basic 2D and 3D matrix math and a tiny bit of quaternions, but even things like understanding what a basis is, whether a matrix is singular, or how to do an orthographic projection is very useful. Again, though, this may be covered in the university's computer graphics course. Granted if you put this in the course it could significantly lower the load on teaching this math in graphics and allow time for more advanced topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Combinatorics is also useful, if only because being able to count the number of unique password combinations of $n$ characters is useful. Cryptography is also traditionally a mathematical field, and is useful for all sorts of reasons, but may be a &lt;em&gt;taaad&lt;/em&gt; advanced for a low level survey course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as vonbrand pointed out, whichever combination of these you choose, formal instruction in proofs is very important. It can be done for any or all of these, and the merits of proving correctness is immense, even if they never &quot;formally&quot; do it again. Proofs also tend to introduce the ability to clearly express mathematical thoughts in words, even if those words are still surrounded by notation. That's a skill that isn't always valued highly enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, there's a lot of useful math. The most useful is by far discrete, but the other math can be extremely useful to know depending on what the department already covers, what it wishes it didn't have to cover, and what sort of electives and specializations they offer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="521" LastEditorUserId="521" LastEditDate="2014-04-17T22:46:55.087" LastActivityDate="2014-04-17T22:46:55.087" CommentCount="0" />

I would argue that the university should not offer such programs. I think that computer science is more of a subfield of math than the other way around, which is why I might give you an overload of topics here ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The topics that you include should obviously depend on the rest of the curriculum. Of course, it's impossible to cover any of this topics comprehensively, but you should identify the elements that are important in the other courses that are offered and make the students comfortable with the ideas and math (with 'math', I mean the kind of deductions and/or calculations that are commonly done in this field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This list probably differs from what professional programmers would say. A financial programmer would probably focus on probability, a game programmer on linear algebra (and maybe calculus), a cryptographer on number theory and information theory, and I can go on for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried to order the list &lt;em&gt;extremely loosely&lt;/em&gt; in order of $ \frac{\text{usefulness}}{\text{difficulty}} $&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;These are very important and not hard to learn. One of many possible uses is in algorithm analysis, where students are expected to do calculations with fractions, powers and logarithms. To my surprise, many of the computer science students had trouble with this (but of course, not everyone has the same background in math, so maybe you should do an extra section for the people that need extra practice with the basic math skills, just to not bother the students that have a sound knowledge with stuff that is way too easy for them). You can also fit things like proving something with induction in here and maybe more advanced skills such as finding a solution for a recurrent equation (just because they don't fit in anywhere else).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymptotics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Big O and it's friends are used in most courses about algorithmics, and limits provide a sound way to reason and provide rigor in calculus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graph theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Graph theory is a very hot topic in computer science (and it will probably stay to be that way for a few decades). There is a large amount of algorithms important for computer science (this becomes very interesting if you combine it with probability: this way you can do stuff like facebooks friend suggestions), but in one course I would just focus on a few elementary algorithms (maybe something with node coloring or min/max cut, tree searches and a little bit on parallel algorithms).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linear algebra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Extensively used in graphics and just a basic skill that comes in handy when doing anything geometric.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combinatorics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Combinatorics pop up in a lot of places in algorithmics. For one course I would give some example of combinatoric proofs, and teach some basic stuff about binomial coefficients. Generating functions are very useful IMO, but probably way out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probabililty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Probabilty is another topic that pops up all over the place. There is a lot you can cover as well. You can combine discrete probability with combinatorics and continuous probability with calculus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Students should be able to have a grasp of differential and integral calculus. In my country, this is mostly high school stuff, but high schools are of varying quality and there is some new stuff as well (partial integration, integration by substitution).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Some basic number theory is used for encryption and sometimes comes in handy while analyzing algorithms. Basic topics are greatest common divisors, smallest common multiples, modular arithmetic...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differential equations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Needed for simulation of real-world phenomenons. Programmers using this would be programmers working with graphics or simulations, and they would typically use finite-difference methods, as opposed to a mathematical approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Used for encryption, compression and reliable transmission over noisy channels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This maybe a little bit of a rant and it probably displays my view that for every mathematical field, you have a subfield in algorithmics (which in its turn is a part of computer science). I think that a student should have a good understanding of each of these topics to have a firm mathematical basis. In your situation it's probably a good idea to look at the courses and how many students take them, and maybe ask other professors on their opinion (for example, if there is a graphics course that has a low percentage of students that succeed, it may have to do with the amount of linear algebra, if there are no courses on cryptography or compression you can skip the number theory and information theory, etc...).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After this long list you can probably see why I think it's a bad idea to have just one (or even none) mathematics course in a computer science curriculum...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="915" LastEditorUserId="915" LastEditDate="2014-04-17T01:53:50.817" LastActivityDate="2014-04-17T01:53:50.817" CommentCount="5" />

Second is important, because you cannot teach students everything, and at the same time trying to get into a new field all by yourself is quite hard (i.e. it's good to know the barest basics of everything). The third are these which aren't directly useful, but present meta-concepts that happen all the time (a bit like design patterns in programming); you can live without them, but intuition you gain there makes life much easier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The list was sorted by (subjectively defined) importance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math that is actually useful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic.&lt;/em&gt; How to handle quantifiers and read formulas, tautologies, satisfiability; less important: free variables, substitutions and unifiers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asymptotics.&lt;/em&gt; This is a must. The big-oh notation, etc., term manipulation, basic limits, sequences and series, both $\to \infty$ and $\to 0$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Graph theory.&lt;/em&gt; This is a must. Graphs are so prevalent and ubiquitous nowadays that it would be a major setback to not know the basics of graph theory (e.g. searching algorithms, connectedness and flows).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linear algebra.&lt;/em&gt; This is a must. What is a linear space, matrices, determinants, orthogonalization, linear programming, perhaps even eigenvalues.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Probability.&lt;/em&gt; Strongly desirable. Discrete spaces, Bayes theorem, expected values, Markov's, Chebyshev and Chernoff inequalities, the law of large numbers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data processing.&lt;/em&gt; Strongly desirable. It's important to know how to process a gathered set of data without destroying some of its vital properties. This includes a bit of statistics, some filters, means, clustering, basic approximation, modelling and regression.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math that you can run into, and is generally good to know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Numerical analysis.&lt;/em&gt; Floating-point arithmetic and error-analysis are a must.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universal algebra.&lt;/em&gt; It's essential to make the students not afraid of abstract structures. No advanced stuff, no need for all the groups/rings/skew fields definitions. The barest essentials so that students won't run scared when they see algebraic data types in functional programming, monoids in automata theory or group theory in cryptography.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statistical and probabilistic modelling.&lt;/em&gt; This is strongly desirable. Markov chains and Monte-Carlo methods.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Differential equations.&lt;/em&gt; Differential equations happen to explain a lot about world's interactions and are used frequently in multitude of practical applications. This is strongly desirable, because it's just hard to learn them with no help.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information theory and cryptography.&lt;/em&gt; This is a must for modern programmers. Symmetric and public-key cryptography, handshakes, entropy, notion of entropy extractor, Kolmogorov complexity, impossibility of perfect compression, lower bound on comparation-based sorting complexity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signal processing.&lt;/em&gt; Fourier transform is strongly desirable. Kalman filters would be good, but there's not enough time. Just anything that would let them reduce the noise in a practical setting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math that lets you build more awesome math.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Term rewriting.&lt;/em&gt; Notion of term rewriting is very powerful and underappreciated. A lot of processes can be explained in terms of term rewriting and it's good to know the relevant intuitions. It's useful for showing termination property of algorithms. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automata theory.&lt;/em&gt; The notion of finite automaton is a must.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complexity theory.&lt;/em&gt; Basic complexity classes and inter-dependencies (including randomized algorithms classes). Maybe other models of computations like $\lambda$-calculus or circuits.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Number theory.&lt;/em&gt; The theory being beautiful and enriching is enough for me here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game theory.&lt;/em&gt; You can find game theory in unexpected places, it's good to have this perspective. Nash equilibrium, prisoner dilemma, second-price auction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's apparent that there's just too many things to cover during 2-semester course.&#xA;If I had to pick, then I would choose the whole first group and nothing else (cryptography can be self-learned).

I'm assuming this is a program that is geared toward engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I've personally found the most useful in my work are linear algebra and signal analysis (Fourier transforms, convolution with filter kernels, etc.)  Again, though, this is largely due to industry in which I work (industrial automation), where I deal with geometric transformations and interpretation of signals.

If I was in data mining or optimization, I might need to know more about linear programming and simplex methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I will say is that I learned a lot more from my focused courses than I did from the 'survey' courses.  My major included a required survey engineering course that covered a wide range of topics, but it covered each topic so briefly (no more than a week on a given area) that there was barely time to even get a taste of what the subject offered.  I can understand the intention of the course (to help undergraduates discover what focus they might want to pursue), but I didn't learn anything significant from it that stuck with me.  As such, it might be better to just teach Calculus, Linear Algebra or some other classic subject in full introductory depth, perhaps giving the student the option of which one to take.  The student will retain more from the increased depth of the course and will likely develop better mathematical skills as a result of having to tackle more challenging problems than could be raised in a survey course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="979" LastActivityDate="2014-04-17T13:48:46.100" CommentCount="0" />

Now I wish I had used the oportunity far more foten, but hey, what looks like a mistake now I percieved as perfectly all right then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Namely there were two noteworthy occasions when I enjoyed office hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is kind of long but I need you to walk through it to see the big picture. In my introductory course for calculus, I was very lucky to have &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; talented and enthusiastic professor. He himself designed a very clever e-learning system on which even the tests were based, so chances were when you spend enough time and effort with it, you'd have a very good chance reaching a top score in the test. When tests were written, there were math books available at a makeshift desk on a grass patch in the middle of the campus, and when you needed a help from a book, you simply walked off the test room (where around 200 students were writing their tests), had a go with the book and then resumed with your test. On the desk, there was a big cardboard sign with F1 written on it (the course was meant for aspiring software engineers, you see). The lectures were superbly conducted and fun to be at, too. Yet the turnup for office hours (if I may call it so) was never below 150. Why? The biggest lecture room was booked so that everyone could come. There was the professor and his TAs, too, so that councensual advice and reasoning could be presented 'live'. The office hours took place at 20:00 to 22:00 on the night before every test. The e-learning system allowed for sumbiting problems directly to a database that would be looked through at the office hours. Once, when a very &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; football (or soccer, if you like) match collided with the schedule, the professor brought a projector (what an asset, back then, with the lamp costing two month's worth of students' accomodation!) ant let the students watch the &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; moments (and watched with them). To that he noted domething like &lt;em&gt;You have books, seminars, our e-learning thing, online forum* with all the teachers, well, you have pretty much everything. My duty as a teacher is to motivate you, to get you to learning at any cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;*This was in 2005, when online fora and e-learning for maths was not as common as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you see, the courses were not only very successful, enlighting and encouraging (some students even switched to maths from computers!), but also they were fun and inviting and adventurous (we all know here how &lt;em&gt;adventurous&lt;/em&gt; maths can be, but then we were still virtually untouched). And, what I find very important - everybody from other universities envied us when we told stories about our calculus course, so we eagerly went in for more! And got a good calculus basis in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I failed an exam miserably when I had been very confident about my knowledge. I asked after the exam if I can come to the office hours. To this the answer was &lt;em&gt;But off course, I had been waiting the whole semester for you to come! If you have time, we can look at it right now!&lt;/em&gt; I had time so I went for it. And as he reviewed my test, two things became apparent: I did really vastly overestimate my knowledge and understanding, and I wasn't a complete failure either; and at the end I got a grade acceptable for me. Word about that spread quickly - no one after me got his grade updated during the office hours, but overall the grades of those who went to consult were improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="981" LastActivityDate="2014-04-17T16:56:37.230" CommentCount="0" />

This by itself allowed the students to see that they would be 1) using previously learned information, and 2) learning more than what they already know. Another plus to giving a pretest is that if all the students are familiar with a topic, say solving one step variable equations, they you do not have to reteach the material, but rather give a review of the topic, which will allow you to focus more on the new material that hey students may have difficulties with. Because you have given a pretest, you can use that as your data for why you are not &quot;teaching&quot; the section. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A way you can make the point concrete that something is a prerequisite, is by giving them a problem that they should be able to solve by the end of the course, you could tell them that they have already learned some of the methods needed to solve the problem, and the course they are in will teach them the rest of the methods necessary to accomplish the task.

We're focusing on topological data analysis and computational homology.  All the topology in the course has been self-contained, meaning that essentially no previous experience in topology was required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book we're using is  &lt;em&gt;Computational Topology: An Introduction&lt;/em&gt;, by H. Edelsbrunner and J. Harer. It's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/imag/courses/Vaccarino/Edels_Book.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;, or you buy it &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0821849255&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in print&lt;/a&gt; (I did this and found it worthwhile). The author works in computer science, and it is written in a style that engineers would appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The professor began the class by explaining our basic problem: if we have a bunch of data points from some topological space, how do we figure out what space the data came from?  He continued by showing us various motivating examples to explain why this question is well-posed, e.g. a ton of points obviously taken from a circle.  He moved on with illustrations and animations to explain (at least visually, in the 2D case) how the Vietoris-Rips complex works, then worked up to bar codes / persistence diagrams.  We were exposed to essentially everything we were going to do over the course of the semester, so we had the &quot;big picture&quot; in our heads right away.  This was very important, especially because I had no background in algebraic topology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We spent the next couple weeks learning the basics of abstract simplicial complexes and their embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^n$.  Everything here was intuitive. Most examples had dimension $2$ (i.e. visually, graphs with some triangles filled in). In this context, homology groups were easily motivated by Betti numbers, which conceptually bridge the gap to group theory.  &quot;What we want is to know the number of components, the number of missing 'circles', the number of missing 'spheres', etc.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get the Betti numbers, we needed to learn how homology groups worked.  Working in this discrete context everything is very constructible, so we could actually make the $C_p$, $Z_p$, and $B_p$ groups (cf p.96 of Edelsbrunner's book), along with the $\delta$ maps, for small examples.  I went home and did this for a whole bunch of examples until I understood how ranks of the matrices related to the &quot;missing pieces&quot; interpretation.  Shortly after this, the professor gave us homework where we had to compute the $\bmod{2}$ and $\bmod{3}$ Betti numbers of the Torus, Klein Bottle, and projective plane from given triangulations (which of course was expected to be done with computational algebra software, not by hand.)  This really cemented the whole point of the course for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After some more theory about persistence, we started using &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/javaplex/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;javaplex&lt;/a&gt; (in conjunction with MATLAB, for most of us) to actually get our hands dirty with some data.  A few weeks ago, we were given a few data sets, told which manifolds they came from, and told find the Betti numbers using a barcode analysis.   For our final assignment, we were given several data sets, but no other information, and tasked with figuring out what topological space they came from.  (One of the data sets was an embedding of a certain well known $3$-manifold in $\mathbb{R}^9$.)  So, we got to take the whole thing to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, it probably wouldn't take much to adapt this course towards engineering students.  A few less proofs, a few more computation-based homeworks and lectures, and earlier introduction to javaplex (or another topology package) would suffice.  The most critical aspect of adapting the course would be to keep the big picture in everyone's mind at all times, so that the definitions and influx of information doesn't become overwhelming.

Every single one was a conjecture, which we had to answer T/F and either formally prove or provide a counterexample for. Naturally, some of these questions were far easier to answer than others. You got 1 point for guessing T/F correctly, and 2 points for a correct explanation (half credit for kind of getting there). He'd grade the first consecutive 30 you made an attempt at, to prevent too much guessing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why was do I adore this test so much?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provides flexibility, and allows you to play to your strengths. Since you only have to answer a subset of questions, you don't have to worry about knowing everything. Still, you have to answer a majority of questions so it doesn't allow you to have too many weaknesses either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It requires you to &lt;em&gt;identify&lt;/em&gt; which questions are even feasible for you to answer. I'm not saying put &quot;T/F P=NP&quot; on your test to gull weaker students into trying to prove things they can't. I'm saying that even being able to recognize trivial counterexamples and do those before they start on the more elaborate proofs (or trickier counterexamples) is a great skill and measures (IMO) a lot about their grasp of the material. I'm not usually a fan of time pressure on tests, but it really works here, and is made up for by the fact that they don't have to answer every question. Heck, this fact alone makes it a good candidate for an open book test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It encourages simple, concise, elegant proofs. Of course, we all know that theorems don't spring up out of the aether, fully formed, with no rough drafts. Those simple proofs in books were worked and polished to death. However, the time pressure forces students to really consider &quot;what is the easiest way to show this is true/false?&quot; Even if it doesn't get you the best proof possible, it gets them thinking in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously I'm not saying that this is the one true test. Different tests have different goals. What I do think is that tests like these not only test mastery, but also forces the student to think in new ways and enhances their education in addition to just testing them. It uses time pressure in a constructive way. It uses it to get them to think critically, rather than just staring at them angrily for rederiving a 30/60/90 triangle from an equilateral instead of memorizing it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't speak highly enough of how much I think tests like this do tests correctly from both a teaching and a learning perspective.

So I'd worry that this single course does half a job &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because there isn't time to cover the necessary material, but because there isn't time to teach someone to think like a mathematician. If you crack the latter then the former is just picking up the right book when you need it. Or of learning geometry in the computer graphics course, mechanics in the physical modelling course, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't know whether your CS course does what I thought of as CS back in the day, or whether it's primarily concerned with producing employable software/hardware engineers ready to go. The mathematics requirements of each are rather different, but it might be that in the CS case, a lot of stuff that I consider to be mathematics will in fact be taught in the course, it just won't be called mathematics. So I don't know quite how to interpret &quot;this is the only mathematics course they'll take&quot;. If they really do no other mathematics then to me it's not CS: call it software engineering. But I don't want to argue over what you call your courses, I'm just trying to understand what's called for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, this may be highly controversial, but my instinct is that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the CS syllabus includes theoretical computer science, then the mathematics syllabus need only provide the necessary grounding for that. Consult the TCS syllabus to figure out what that is. There should also be content beyond that, but it doesn't actually matter what it is. Either elementary calculus or algebra provide plenty of opportunity for rigorous proof. Mechanics or probability/statistics might be more practically useful in life, but I think introductory courses don't really have time to avoid hand-waving important results so you risk sacrificing rigour. As long as the students have been taught what &quot;doing mathematics&quot; is, the specific content will appear in the courses it relates to, whether that's TCS or games programming.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the CS syllabus is all programming with very little TCS, then the &quot;mathematics&quot; syllabus should be TCS in disguise because that's the only way to present any theoretical material at all. Ditch the algebra (except that they'll need to know what vectors and matrices are) and calculus, do what you can from: computability (including classes of formal language and the machines that decide them), complexity, combinatorics, graph theory, information theory (entropy and codes), maybe some cryptology (which will bring in a bit of number theory). One course, two semesters, I guess you can introduce at least 4 fields in enough depth to matter? Teaching 'em mathematical physics so they can write games or the software for X-ray interferometers is someone else's problem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm also guessing a bit what's considered &quot;remedial&quot;. I'd expect an 18-year-old who wants to do a CS degree to already have mathematics education, and I would expect that education to include basic: geometry, trigonometry, dynamics, probability, calculus (know the fundamental theorem of calculus, a list of indefinite integrals, and the product rule. Maybe know l'Hôpital's rule. Probably not able to prove any of them but might be able to prove the derivatives of polynomials from first principles), proof by induction, maybe some abstract algebra, maybe some non-trivial statistics (&quot;compute the mean&quot; is trivial, by non-trivial I mean, &quot;what's a two-tail test?&quot; on upwards). But my expectations are based on a different education system, so might be out of line for your students. If any of that isn't remedial, it might be worth throwing it in just so that your degree provides a broad mathematical grounding in addition to the specialized CS. Unfortunately this turns back into that bucket list. I don't believe you can expect to take students who have never heard the word &quot;integrate&quot; except in the context of Brown v. Board of Education, and give them broad mathematics in the time available. So you might have to give up the aspirations of the mathematics department and cater to the CS department directly. I guess you're more or less at the mercy of how much time they give you?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any or all applied mathematics &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be useful to a programmer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you won't get far writing a physics engine if you don't know mechanics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you can't be a quant without sophisticated statistical modelling and some economics / game theory&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;without numerical analysis all your floating-point code blows up due to the &quot;obvious&quot; algorithm being numerically unstable&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you actually can't provide all of applied mathematics in the compulsory courses of a single undergraduate degree anyway, so why try. Ultimately it's domain knowledge for some programmers, it's not essential to the actual programming. You could just as well say that programmers &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; need to know tax law ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, IIRC the &quot;computation&quot; (there was no &quot;computer science&quot;) undergraduates at my university did something like half the first-year mathematics syllabus and then had to take a &quot;foundations of mathematics&quot; course including set theory and formal logic. How we laughed. But the intention of the course was to prepare them for academic computer science if anything: I don't think there was required to be any great advantage in preparing to be a programmer compared with the mathematics course.

Typically my exam contains five or six question, and one of those consists of, say, four true/false questions. The way I do it is that I make four claims, and students are to either give a quick proof or give a counterexample. I design them in a way that either it is easy to construct a counterexample using the body of examples covered in class, or there is a two line argument reducing the claim to a result in the lecture notes. I think explanations are a must.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I also include trick questions. Then a good explanation for a wrong choice earns partial credit. For example, if a student gives an argument that covers the generic case, but fails in a special case that actually leads to a counterexample, then I will be relatively generous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example in first semester calculus I might ask something like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fact or fiction?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A) If the sequence $(a_n)$ converges, then so does the sequence $(a_n/n)$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;B) If the sequence $(a_n/n)$ converges, then so does the sequence $(a_n)$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;C) If the sequences $(a_n)$ and $(a_nb_n)$ both converge, then so does the sequence $(b_n)$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here a student is expected to A) for example appeal to the result about the product of two converging sequences being convergent itself, B) come up with a counterexample, C) come up with a counterexample, but will get partial credit for realizing that $(b_n)$ should converge as a quotient of two converging sequences, but forgets about the possibility of an attempt to divide by zero (that actually is crucial in finding a counterexample).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In second semester calculus I might ask something like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fact or fiction?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A) If a function is differentiable on the interval $[0,1]$, then it is also Riemann integrable over that interval.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;B) If the sequence $(a_n)$ converges, then the power series $\sum_n a_nx^n$ converges for all $x$ with $|x|&amp;lt;1$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;C) If the sequence $(a_n)$ converges, then the power series $\sum_n a_nx^n$ converges for all $x$ with $|x|\le1$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A student should be able to prove A by recalling from first semester that a differentiable function is continuous and combine that with a theorem from second semester telling that a continuous function is integrable over a closed interval.

Good slides complement the things you talk about and should work best when accompanied by a talker. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Books and lecture notes, on the other hand are self-contained and are designed for people who read them on their own. There is few ambiguity, and unwieldy calculations are put into in-line formulas, blocks of equations and are interlaced with comments. They are sometimes printed out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because their use is so different, I suggest to pick the mode of presentation which fits best for its intended use: Slides style for talks/lectures, book style for lecture notes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="108" LastActivityDate="2014-04-19T18:17:39.867" CommentCount="0" />

Assuming we are talking about something relatively agnostic to the subject area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It solves a number of the drawbacks of the slide technology. For instance, whereas slides are essentially a one-dimensional sequentially-arranged (though randomly accessible) structure, Prezi allows for any 2 dimensional arrangement. Though 2 dimensionality doesn't confine your structure to 2 dimensions (i.e. you're not stuck to a grid structure; you could use a tree or other structure). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have used a Prezi to create a main, sequential thread for a lecture (picture it as horizontally arranged) with side-trips off each slide which can go off in another direction temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/dZNYw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;schematic of Prezi structure&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's one possibility, but obviously there are others based on whatever type of structure you can think of that an be laid out in 2 dimensions and makes sense for the organization and interrelatedness of your subject matter. Another &quot;dimension&quot; is size. You can compress blocks of explanatory text within slides so that they are visible, but not intrusive. Clicking on them will zoom into them. For example, definitions that are useful to have at hand, or elaborations that you would not go into detail with in class would be available for the students to use when they are reviewing the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can define a main &quot;path&quot; through the lecture, but alternate paths are possible just by clicking around. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not the best example for what you're asking about, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prezi.com/eanmkdg71pto/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here is a Prezi I made&lt;/a&gt; fairly quickly (from templates) to aid in an informal presentation I was collaborating on for a student-group discussion about one of Alan Schoenfeld's research studies.

Draw an open curve and ask students how much area it enclosed.  Presumably they will recognize that the question has no real answer -- there is no way to tell what is &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; an open curve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Perhaps one way to dramatize this is using a Paint-type program...  They typically have a &quot;fill&quot; tool that lets you fill an enclosed region with a solid color.  If you draw a curve that is not closed and try to &quot;fill&quot; it the paint pours out and fills the entire drawing area.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to why they have this problem, I suspect it is because the axes themselves, together with horizontal and vertical gridlines, create visual &quot;noise&quot; that is hard to distinguish from the actual curve or surface.  For example, when the graph of $y = \sqrt{1-x^2} + 2$ is drawn it looks like an open upper semicircle, but when the graph of $y = \sqrt{1-x^2}$ is drawn looks like a &lt;em&gt;closed&lt;/em&gt; semicircle because the x-axis appears to be part of the picture.  I imagine something analogous happens in 3-dimensions; I note that in the example you gave, students had difficulty recognizing that the plane $z=0$ was not already part of the figure, and I suspect this may have had something to do with how the surface was sketched or plotted (did the illustration include some kind of shading to show where the xy-plane was?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some thing that might help is to use more examples where the &quot;opening&quot; to the surface does not easily align with an axis or other visual element that could masquerade as part of the surface.  Of course, this technique could make the computations more complicated, as we typically prefer examples that have precisely that kind of arrangement because they are easier to work with!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;  It occurs to me that another reason students have trouble with the notion that open surfaces do not enclose a definite volume is because that idea runs utterly counter to everyday, normal experience.  Consider measuring cups, cereal bowls, 2-gallon paint pails.  Our very notion of &quot;volume&quot; is, in the world of real life, based on filling &lt;em&gt;open containers&lt;/em&gt; like graduated cylinders or beakers.  Even in calculus classes we give them questions where they are supposed to find the dimensions of an open-top box or cylinder containing a maximal volume under certain constraints.  So of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; they think that a surface that is open encloses a volume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What makes this notion so stubborn?  Perhaps it stems in part from the fact that when we do consider an open surface it typically has a boundary curve that lies in a plane, and therefore there is a &quot;natural&quot; way to cap it.  That, after all, is how real-life containers work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the best way to deal with issues like this -- where there is a technical usage that differs significantly from the way a word or concept is used in everyday experience -- is to confront it head-on:  before discussing integration over surfaces or volumes, it is essential to have a discussion about the difference between open and closed surfaces, and to be explicit about the precise way the phrase &quot;enclosed volume&quot; or &quot;volume of the interior&quot; is used in this context.  And in every example you demonstrate you should begin by asking:  Is this surface open or closed?  If open, how can we close it off to create a well-defined interior?  etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29" LastEditorUserId="29" LastEditDate="2014-04-23T02:05:33.380" LastActivityDate="2014-04-23T02:05:33.380" CommentCount="0" />

(Donoghue, 2003)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Curriculum design is (should be) about structuring the subject matter in a way that students can form a coherent understanding. At the least, it is an arrangement that the designers find coherent. This means that it's not necessarily true that the options are: square roots are more common, square roots are more useful, or square roots are easier. Nor is it necessarily true that there is one correct way. So, one way may be produced, become traditional, and then be perpetuated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reform curricula have come up against this time and again. Sometimes, the way we do things in math education are traditional and people don't &lt;em&gt;want to&lt;/em&gt; question them, even in the face of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I think you have a good question, perhaps a more forward-looking question might be whether we can find reasons to teach logarithms earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Squares and square roots are connected to a particular 2D representation (squares) that can be used as a model for multiplication. It's popular for assisting students beyond the tenacious idea of multiplication as repeated addition. A representational leg up like that may be (just speculating here) one convenient reason that squares and square roots can be placed early in a curriculum &quot;pathway.&quot; I'm really only guessing here; IANACD (I Am Not A Curriculum Designer).

The professor wanted a computational flavor to the course, so we introduced Magma right off the bat.  We wanted to allow the students to experiment with permutations without needing to actually do large computations themselves.  As part of my contribution to the course, I was put in charge of the Magma side of things, both making the assignments and teaching them how to use the software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a few in class lectures on Magma syntax and a couple ungraded, basic-syntax mini-assignments, I gave the students &lt;a href=&quot;http://plaza.ufl.edu/gruberan/GroupTheory_S13/CA1.pdf&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which they finished in about two weeks.  I had to help them a lot by email.  Everyone finished the second problem once they figured out the list syntax.  In retrospect I think the first problem was a bit too difficult. I had expected the students to have at least a little programming experience, and it turned out most of them didn't, so the Monte Carlo type solution was not intuitive. They just weren't comfortable enough with conditionals and control structures to use them to tackle unfamiliar concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I gave two more small projects like this, but I don't have copies online.  The second one involved verifying the Chinese remainder theorem, calculating isomorphism classes of abelian groups of some given orders, and taking quotients of abelian groups.  The third one was about alternating groups and conjugacy classes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the students found Magma to be more trouble than it was worth.  They didn't learn as much from the assignments as I had expected them to.  The goal had been to allow students to see more complex group structure in action without actually having to go through the trouble of calculating everything on their own, but it seems that this difficulty was simply replaced by the difficulty of learning the new language. I had expected they would enter an &quot;exploratory phase&quot; after learning the basic tools where they used learned a whole lot of group theory (because that's what happened to me after I learned Magma), but it didn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, my experience suggests that even several days in the computer lab was not sufficient to introduce Magma.  I suspect it may only be practical to use Magma for a first course in group theory when you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that students have at least some previous programming experience.  If they do, I still think it could be a great way to learn. It also might be worth considering use in a first year graduate level course in abstract algebra, where the students are committed enough to put in the time to learn programming concepts if they don't know how to yet.  (Also, at least for me, the most educational part of learning Magma was messing around with the SmallGroups package, which is probably out of the scope of a first year course in group theory.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S., to answer your final question, the only resource I have ever personally used to learn Magma has been the &lt;a href=&quot;http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/&quot;&gt;Magma handbook&lt;/a&gt;, which has been so tremendously helpful that I have felt the need to seek an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I remembered that I had made some Magma notes for my students, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://plaza.ufl.edu/gruberan/GroupTheory_S13/Magma_Notes_1.txt&quot;&gt;quick reference&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=&quot;http://plaza.ufl.edu/gruberan/GroupTheory_S13/Magma_Lecture_2.txt&quot;&gt;short programs&lt;/a&gt; we went over in class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="263" LastEditorUserId="263" LastEditDate="2014-04-21T15:07:37.740" LastActivityDate="2014-04-21T15:07:37.740" CommentCount="0" />

Can they generalize to more variables?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, work with them on a quadratic equation, something like $x^2+1=y^2$. Can they find any solutions? What about $3x^2-5y^2=2$? Do they see how hard it is to get a general method?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can start to talk about what Hilbert's 10th Problem says. This can facilitate several interesting discussions for a high school audience&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Solving equations in integers (Why have mathematicians been interested in solving them since pretty much antiquity? Where do they appear in real life?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Algorithms and decision procedures (What is an algorithm? What makes one better than another?

Consigning this topic to trigonometry has several disadvantages. Many students who carry their mathematical study through the course in trigonometry seem to get the idea that the usefulness of logarithms is confined to trigonometry. Those who do not reach trigonometry lose what is at once an important tool and an elegant system. In the separation of the treatment of exponents and logarithms the theory seems to contain a discontinuity. The laws for commensurable exponents are carefully proved and then the theory of logarithms is made to appear to rest on that of exponents. But most of the logarithms used are incommensurable! The plan here proposed is to introduce incommensurable exponents with reference to the continuity of an exponential curve and to pass immediately to logarithms. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The author also cites a separate document arguing that logarithms be studied along with exponents:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[A report] of the Committee on the Teaching of Mathematics to Students of Engineering, calls for the teaching of logarithms in logical connection with the subject of exponents rather than with trigonometry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This report is foot-noted as: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Syllabus of Mathematics,&quot; Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, 1912.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;but an APA citation is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;American Society for Engineering Education.

Mostly I find myself in the position of picking up the pieces when the kids are failing and fearing more failure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The root of the problem, in my experience, is the way algebra is taught as something alien, and in particular, different from arithmetic, which it really isn’t (at least in the early years).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So first off, &lt;strong&gt;constant emphasis on the fact that “$x$ is just a number you don’t know yet”&lt;/strong&gt;.  So it behaves like a number, and you can do all the stuff to it, that you can do to numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, the nature of equality $2 + 3 = 4 + 1$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And from there, the fact that when you do the same thing to both sides, you still end up with two things that are equal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always&lt;/strong&gt; “do the same thing to both sides” (since this is clearly based on the nature of equality), &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; “move this from one side to the other and change the sign” (which is a magic rule that makes no sense until you have a deeper understanding).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you get them happy with the idea that doing the same thing to both sides is the way to go, you can give them suggestions for which things to do in which order, but stress that provided they rigorously write down the consequence of the thing they decide to do to both sides, they won't go wrong (although some ways are harder – look out for these as a pointer that choosing another way will be easier).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manipulation of each line is easy, once you’ve got them to decide what they’re going to do at each stage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the example, $3x + 5 = 14$:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, decide what to do to both sides (subtract 5)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write down first what you have ($3x + 5$), then do what you’ve decided.

You can look at what is required at each grade level and get an idea of what you need to teach. You'll need to assess your student against current grade level requirements and then work backwards until you get to the point they understand. That reveals their 'deficiency'. Then you remediate.

I realize that this is only some kind of vague intuition, and it would probably confuse a lot of students, but it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; as well help some.  (It &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; help &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; at some point, at least.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let us assign a &quot;$0$&quot; to false statements and a &quot;$1$&quot; to true ones (this is a common convention at least here in Poland).  Now &quot;$p\implies q$&quot; is true iff $p\le q$ (note that in the first formula we treat $p$ and $q$ as &lt;em&gt;propositional variables&lt;/em&gt;, and in the second as &lt;em&gt;numeric variables&lt;/em&gt;, which is clearly an abuse of notation!).  This way one can view a material implication as a way of saying that &quot;one sentence ($p$) &lt;em&gt;implying&lt;/em&gt; another one ($q$) means that the latter one must be &lt;em&gt;at least as true&lt;/em&gt; (whatever that means!) as the former one&quot;.  In other words, when going from the antecedent to the consequent, we cannot &quot;lose knowledge&quot;, only gain it.  (Now this is really stretching things from philosophical point of view, and logicians would probably torture and kill me for that; but then again – this is only a (vague) intuition I'm talking about).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way I present this to students (if I do!) is more or less this (with a wink): &quot;So just like $p\land q$ is &lt;em&gt;somehow similar&lt;/em&gt; to (but different from!) $p\cdot q$ – so that even we call $p$ and $q$ the &quot;factors&quot; of the conjunction [at least this is what we do in Polish; we also sometimes call a conjunction a &quot;logical product&quot;, and we do similar things with &lt;em&gt;alternative&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., use words &quot;logical sum&quot; and &quot;summands&quot;)] – in a similar vein, $p\implies q$ is &lt;em&gt;somehow similar&lt;/em&gt; to $p\le q$.  But you know, better forget about it, since &quot;truth&quot; is not &quot;one&quot; and &quot;falsehood&quot; is not &quot;zero&quot; anyway, so what I've just told you is more or less a lie anyway.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="704" LastActivityDate="2014-04-21T20:49:26.587" CommentCount="0" />

Keep the question mark over the equals sign until it is obvious that the equation is true.  Put each version of the equation on a following line, and try to line up the equals signs.

Although there are various not-unreasonable motivations to &quot;rationalize denominators&quot;, I think mostly it is mostly just another not-very-well-motivated rule to test students' &lt;em&gt;compliance&lt;/em&gt;. It is true that polynomials in radicals, with rational coefficients, are simpler than rational expressions in radicals, unless something simplifies surprisingly, it really makes little difference. Perhaps an example of one of the few times this might &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matter is testing exact equality, where the &quot;reduced&quot; polynomial expression is canonical and unique, while rational expressions are not unique. Nevertheless, when looking at polynomials in several algebraic numbers, it quickly becomes non-trivial to decide on nice minimal/canonical polynomial expressions, also. This already happens with $n$th roots of unity with highly composite $n$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For that matter, what about denominators involving several square roots?

The goal of any teacher, &lt;em&gt;especially a teacher in mathematics&lt;/em&gt;, should first and foremost be to make the students understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things are true, how they work, how to prove them... I personally feel that mathematics teachers have a moral duty to at least &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to let their students really understand the material - otherwise the students are just being programmed like computers (they do it correctly, but they have no idea what they're doing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;calculus needs to be taught in a procedural way&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is simply not true.

E.g., it is unclear whether or not we &quot;have license&quot; to declare that &quot;the plane&quot; is &quot;numbers&quot;... although we might have reasons to want to do so. That is, further, we might be unhappy that the arithmetic of complex numbers depends on two-dimensional geometry and geometric intuition for its sense and apparent self-consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Historically, the appearance of complex numbers was taken more seriously in the solution of cubics with three real roots, but for which the formula irremediably involved complex numbers.

Graves found the octonions, and so on. All this work quite blatantly had the motivation of &quot;identifying&quot; geometry and numbers. Grassmann's work was similarly motivated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, yes, many people were uneasy. Kronecker's construction of $\mathbb C$ as a quotient $\mathbb R[x]/\langle x^2+1\rangle$ is not as elementary as one might wish, and not geometric, but &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; arguably a more bullet-proof argument for existence without appeal to geometric intuition.

This assumption wasn't actually essential to the question, and was bothering some people, so I've updated it to remove that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/1879/should-tests-given-after-the-drop-date-be-made-less-difficult-in-order-to-help-t&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;, how difficult should an exam be?  For instance, assume you've decided about what skills should denote a B- student, and that you're free to norm exam scores to course scores as needed.  By adjusting the questions you put on an exam, you can adjust what score a student with B- skills will typically get.  Where should you aim for?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some answers I can think of, which some plusses and minuses:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim for the score traditionally correlated with that grade.  For instance, in the US there's a custom that a B- corresponds to a grade in the 80-82 range, so you could try to write an exam where a score of 80-82 will typically reflect the skills of a B- student.  (Actually, if it's a class where non-exam items will tend to increase grades, aim a bit lower.)  The advantage is that, if the exam, there's &quot;no curve&quot;, and students tend to feel like they've done well.  A disadvantage is that if you accidentally make the exam too easy (say, a question has a short cut and doesn't reveal as much as you intended), your options are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim a bit lower.  Say, aim for an exam where a score of around 70 reflects a B-.  More importantly, this gives a bit more separation at the top of the class (you have room for a question or two to distinguish the top students from the very good).  On the other hand, students seem to feel like their grades are arbitrary, and they may feel more competitive (and less willing to work and study together) if they feel like their friends doing well will cut into their curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim much lower---say, put a B- around 50 and curve heavily.  This makes the cut-offs between final grades much wider (the gap between a B- and a B might be something like 7 points instead of 3), and therefore a single small mistake has a smaller impact on a score.  Students get quite discouraged by these, in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question is whether there's any actual research suggesting that some of these are clearly good/bad for student learning, and whether there are ethical or practical issues I'm overlooking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastEditorUserId="62" LastEditDate="2014-04-22T22:21:54.843" LastActivityDate="2014-04-22T22:21:54.843" Title="How should exam scores correlate to final grades?"

(Depending on the system, there may be intermediate options; I generally curve exams to an expected median, but some years there are indicators that it's a stronger or weaker group---for instance, I may have particular problems I can do a direct comparison with other year's performances---in which case I adjust the curve a little.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Phrased differently, curving a class (for instance, by saying in advance what percentage will get each grade), is often characterized as being about some kind of competition amongst students.  This isn't necessarily the case.  Curving a class is often using &lt;em&gt;an assumed distribution of student performance to norm the exam&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2014-04-22T18:00:28.930" CommentCount="0" />

Without limits, the Fundamental Theorem[s] cannot be proven.  The concept of a limit is used for nearly every convergence and divergence test, L'Hopitals Rule, definitions of asymptotes, &lt;em&gt;the proof that continuous compounding equates to the law of exponential change&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;required for a rigorous proof of the chain rule&lt;/em&gt;, required for proof of all the derivative formulas, required for proof of all of the integration techniques, etc., etc.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It literally binds the entire field together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an AP Calculus AB and BC teacher in high school, I initially treated the instruction of limits much like it was treated when I was student, namely, rushed over, given only a cursory look, and slandered as 'kid stuff' or 'simplistic,' concepts that were only necessary for the 'big stuff' up ahead.  Not surprisingly every time I found myself teaching the later material, I began to realize, as an educator, that every contention I attempted to make about the subtlety of the calculus relied on limits as the underpinning of those arguments.  Don't get me wrong ... I had always proved nearly every algorithm in the course, and stressed the importance of epsilon delta proofs, etc., but had skipped over that of limits.

His teacher is pretty much useless; my son has to come to me or my wife (let's just say that each of us has about 100+ college and graduate credits in math, and Ph.D.s in math intensive fields) to ask for explanations, and after almost a year of trig, his active formulae include mostly $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x=1$ (which he knew anyway as Pythagorean theorem), and I am not sure he can do $\sin(x+y)$ without referring to his cheat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am seriously considering going to the high school math department and asking to pull my son out to homeschool him for AP Calc BC using the materials that I trust (which would probably have to include the proofs of Lebesgue-Borel lemma and the extreme value Weierstrass theorem; I learned them when I was 15 or 16, so I don't see a big deal here). My big question is: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how do I approach high school math department without completely pissing them off?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My son still has to be there for three more years. His precalc teacher actually runs the school math team (although I think they missed organizing AMC 10 this year, partly because the school was closed due to snow on the primary competition day). Finally, I want somebody to write a ref letter to attest to my son's math skills when he graduates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The specific complaint my son has about the teacher is that he does not explain things enough, and he does not explain things well. My understanding of a typical way the teacher interacts with the students is that he gives a bunch of definitions, and then gives assignments, many of which are defined as vaguely as &quot;Well, here is a full set of 60 problems. Work about half of them; there will be 12 from this set on the test&quot;. All of the assignments are on the publisher's website. Technology is a blessing, of course: if a student cannot factor $2x^2-5x-3$, the system will hold student's hand, show calculations step by step, and then generate another $x^2 + 3x +2$ to let students show that they've learnt something. However, in my view, the technology should untie teacher's hands so that they are offer &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; explanations and examples worked through in class. The technology can be used to test the basic knowledge and afford a C grade; however, the grade of A should be earned by doing proofs and derivations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The worst thing, though, is that I finally found out what the dreaded rote memorization is. I heard everybody talk about it as a problem in American math education; I now know what this phrase actually means. I don't think it hit my son as hard in any of the earlier classes as it did in this precalc. The most recent example from his precalc class is the partial fraction decomposition:&#xA;$$&#xA;\frac{x^2 - 3x + 5}{x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 2} = &#xA;\frac{\mbox{stuff}_1}{\mbox{linear binomial}} + \frac{\mbox{stuff}_2}{\mbox{quadratic polynomial}} + \mbox{may be more stuff like that}&#xA;$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The teacher then threw in the concepts of distinct linear factors, repeated linear factors, distinct quadratic factors, repeated quadratic factors -- my son had the terms in the notes, but not the definitions (OK, let's give the benefit of the doubt and assume that the teacher actually gave these definitions in class, and my son failed to copy them down properly; in the end, we had to Google them to make sure we got them right.) The teacher then said that this material is important because they will use this later in integration. Fine, I agree that it is useful when integrating rational functions; but why on earth throw this useless information at this stage, when integration is like a year ahead, and nobody in the class has any clue what the teachers just said? Why asking for these terms on the test? Knowing that $\frac{x+3}{(x^2+5)^2}$ is called &lt;em&gt;repeated quadratic factor&lt;/em&gt; is not helping a student to do the calculation proficiently. I would introduce this decomposition when I would need it when we touch the integrals of $1/(x+a)$ and $1/(x^2+a^2)$. Without context, this information and computational method is going to be lost by the time the (next) class arrives at these integrals, so the (next) teacher would have to work through this, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A minor complaint that my son had was that the teacher did not break down the class efficiently into small groups when small group activities were offered. In my son's view, a better division would be to stratify the class by knowledge/ability, so that more advanced students would work on more complex problems. (In that partial fraction decomposition, what should stuff1 and stuff2 consist of? What degrees other irreducible polynomials could have? Can you create, and solve, a meaningful example with repeated irreducible factors of a sixth degree?). I hear my son here, although in my own teaching experience (a few years of undergraduate teaching in a couple of US universities), I would sometimes make sure that I have at least one strong student in each small group to really explain to other students what's going on. May be my son's teacher does the same; may be he does not really care how the knowledge is being transferred.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can form two sorts of implications for the calculus class that is coming up next fall, and none of them is promising.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The math department / district does not have a quality control system in place. My son said that he wanted to give his negative feedback the way college students do in their student evaluations (and, I believe, in evaluations he gave in some of his other educational institutions). If this is true, then there is no guarantee that the next teacher will be any better.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The math department / district is simply fine with math being taught that way. If this is true, I don't want them to touch my son's math education, as I still hope he'd grow to love math.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way, I see my son better off taking his calc class off the grid -- with me using proper Russian books, or through AoPS, JHU CTY or Stanford EPGY or Coursera or whatever is going to both challenge him and provide better explanations than his school could.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My big plan for my son is that he takes AP Calc BC next year, and then takes stuff like Linear Algebra and Abstract Math online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="742" OwnerDisplayName="StasK" LastEditorUserId="47" LastEditDate="2014-04-23T04:21:10.520" LastActivityDate="2014-04-24T02:53:44.783" Title="Interacting with high school teachers (US)" Tags="&lt;secondary-education&gt;&lt;student-motivation&gt;" AnswerCount="6" CommentCount="24" FavoriteCount="2" />

The &quot;former Soviet&quot; system, as well as many &quot;Soviet bloc&quot; countries, but also to a lesser degree Western European countries, compelled students to take mathematics seriously. The point is ... &quot;or be left behind&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not only does the current U.S. system honorably emphasize &quot;breadth&quot;, but it does also not judge so harshly. For some decades, and, even now, in the U.S. people have many further chances after earlier failures. There is no nation-wide stigma/reward. This is a good thing in many ways, but it is bad in that it allows a certain fraction of people to not try hard, to think that there will always be one more chance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that context... :) ... there is simply no one to turn to for high-school tutoring at the level of the old Soviet and eastern-bloc mathematical establishment. At the same time, ... did it ever really matter? To the extent that &quot;mathematical prowess&quot; was a low-overhead proof of machismo or value-to-the-state, or to corporate entities, aggressive orthodox low-level mathematics (which includes Olympiads, btw) was only of interest as a demonstration of aggression and quickness, not of wisdom about structure of the universe, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, as in my own childhood, hoping that a kid has access to books (or, ... the internet?), there is no lack of &lt;em&gt;opportunities&lt;/em&gt; to learn many things, including much mathematics. The question of learning to feel an &lt;em&gt;obligation&lt;/em&gt; to learn such things is different. This sense of obligation is not currently available in the U.S. Not clear to me that it should be... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do explain to my own daughter that the &quot;standards&quot; promulgated by k-12 schools, and even good universities, and even graduate schools, are ... sub-minimal. The current culture makes understanding such things an abrupt transition. No easy way, I fear. But, in her early 20s, my daughter does seem ever-more able to understand my point to her (for almost 20 years!) that she (and anyone) should &lt;em&gt;embrace&lt;/em&gt; their studies, not thinking first about what's on the exam, and how to minimize effort (as game-theoretically rational as that surely is!), and view &quot;school&quot; as an annoying side-effect or incidental. I tell the same to my grad students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to paraphrase, it's not about the school curriculum at all... which should be only some formality like a driver's license test... but what one (=the kid) &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(And, of course, kids have a hard time understanding such a message, given the ambient culture.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes! :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oop, and the operative advice about how to approach the H.S. teachers to get them on a better track... is... don't.

We always want students to understand the core idea first, and then build from that idea towards an understanding of the details.  When presenting a new topic, we always try to strip away anything that seems extraneous or distracting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But motivation isn't extraneous, and it isn't distracting.  Motivation is necessary for human beings to understand mathematics.  It's not part of the logical structure of mathematics, but it's crucial for developing &lt;em&gt;intuition&lt;/em&gt; about the subject.  If you don't know what something is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it was invented, then you don't really have any hope of understanding it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The narrative that negative numbers don't have square roots, so we should try making some up, is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; motivation for complex numbers.  It's where they came from.  It's the only way for them to make sense.  Absent this motivation, complex numbers will come across as completely arbitrary, and therefore incomprehensible.  Students will feel like there's something they're missing, and they will be right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You raise some objections to presenting this narrative, on the grounds that it leads to &quot;confusion&quot;.

When a student asks how something they just learned can be generalized, or how to tell whether something really works, it means that they already understand it well enough to think about it critically.  The goal of education is not to leave students dumbfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me respond to your individual objections:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For one thing, if we're being rigorous, it's nonsense. What precisely does &quot;all the usual rules apply&quot; mean? What is your proof that a structure obeying the above rules even exists?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are excellent questions, and I think any good explanation of complex numbers should address these directly, at least to some extent.  The definition of complex numbers highlights the fact that we need to codify the rules of algebra (leading, ultimately, to abstract algebra), and raises the question of whether it suffices to have axioms for a mathematical object, or whether we really need to construct it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this discussion is a bit too sophisticated for students at this level, but it should be possible to say something about it.  A student who realizes that such issues arise in mathematics understands things much better than a student who thinks mathematics is always cut-and-dried.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It makes the geometrical facts about complex numbers seem very mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are very mysterious.  It's one of the great mysteries of mathematics that complex numbers work so well, that they are so intimately related to geometry, and that they arise in so many places.  How did we start with square roots of negative numbers and arrive at Euler's formula?  Why is complex analysis so much simpler and more beautiful than real analysis?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If something truly is mysterious, it's ok for students to perceive it that way.  Point out explicitly how amazing and unexpected the geometry is, given that we didn't start with something geometric at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It leads to &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/125186/why-not-to-extend-the-set-of-natural-numbers-to-make-it-closed-under-division-by&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; type of confusion. In the words of 19th century mathematician John T. Graves: &quot;&lt;em&gt;I have not yet any clear views as to the extent to which we are at liberty arbitrarily to create imaginaries, and to endow them with supernatural properties. (...) If with your alchemy you can make three pounds of gold, why should you stop there?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, this isn't confusion.  The student who asked the question on Stack Exchange has grasped the fundamental technique of complex numbers, i.e. &lt;em&gt;making up new number systems to do what we want&lt;/em&gt;, and wants to know how far it goes.  Intellectually, they are doing as well as Graves, and they are on the conceptual path that eventually leads to abstract algebra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A student who &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; ask a question like this after learning about complex numbers hasn't really grasped them.  If you manage to teach complex numbers in a way that doesn't prompt students to ask this question, that means that you've taught less, not more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you won't have time to fully answer questions like this, but that's ok.  Students at the high-school level sometimes get the feeling that mathematics is some kind of closed book, and this is a great opportunity to point out how much mathematics there really is in the world to explore.  Graves' question is one of the most important questions in mathematics, the motivation for huge swaths of modern algebra, and in some sense it still hasn't been fully answered.  It's not a question to avoid --- it's the kind of question you should go out of your way to mention!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastEditorUserId="50" LastEditDate="2014-04-23T05:52:27.637" LastActivityDate="2014-04-23T05:52:27.637" CommentCount="14" />

After all, if it were all about the algebra then we'd continue with the quaternions, octonians, sontarans, and so forth.  But we don't, because complex numbers find themselves used far more than those others and it is their interaction with geometry that is the reason for this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to sketch out an approach that starts with the geometry and leads to the algebra.  The key is to realise complex numbers as an orientation-preserving conformal linear transformations of the plane.  Why should we be interested in such?  Many reasons, but the basic idea is that these preserve the notion of &quot;Turn Left&quot; in that &quot;turning left&quot; commutes with such transformations[1].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, any such transformation consists of a rotation and a uniform scaling.  The rotation is encoded by its angle and the scaling by its scale factor.  So we need two numbers: $r$ and $\theta$.  Composition of transformations results in $(r,\theta) (s,\phi) \mapsto (r s, \theta + \phi)$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is all very well, but it is more complicated than it need to be.  Although the composition rule is nice, the application rule is not.  That is, if we apply $(r,\theta)$ to $\begin{bmatrix}u \\ v \end{bmatrix}$ then the result is $\begin{bmatrix} r \cos(\theta) u - r \sin(\theta) v \\ r \sin(\theta) u + r \cos(\theta) v\end{bmatrix}$.  So in terms of application, it is the numbers $x = r\cos(\theta)$ and $y = r\sin(\theta)$ that are important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that notation, the application rule becomes $\begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix} \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} x u - y v \\ y u + x v \end{bmatrix}$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also the composition rule, and that's because the vector $\begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix}$ is the result of rotating the vector $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ by a certain angle and scaling it by a certain length.  So each vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$ corresponds to applying a rotation and scaling to $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$.  Thus we can identify $\mathbb{C}$onformal orientation-preserving linear transformations with $\mathbb{R}^2$ as the action is full and faithful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Associativity of multiplication, aka composition, is obvious.  Commutativity follows from the geometry in that rotations obviously commute with each other.  Distributivity of multiplication over addition is also obvious since addition is translation and it's geometrically obvious how to change a &quot;translate then rotate&quot; (aka $z(w + c)$) in to &quot;rotate then translate&quot; (aka $z w + z c$).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the square root of minus one, well if you rotate by a quarter turn and rotate by a quarter turn again then you end up pointing backwards.  Simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] I know that this shifts the burden of motivation from complex numbers to that of &quot;knowing how to turn left&quot;, but that's hopefully easier to motivate directly from physics and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="112" LastActivityDate="2014-04-23T07:28:46.503" CommentCount="13" />

The payoff is simply not worth the investment at this stage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I've experienced is: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Students at this level are still developing their mathematical maturity and are not (generally speaking) at a level where $\epsilon-\delta$ stuff truly makes sense. Hence the majority of students simply parrot the instructor without true understanding. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Students lock in single-mindedly on these problems as if the whole of their understanding of calculus depended on it, which at this level it does not, and then miss out on understanding concepts that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; within their grasp -- like the simple notion that a derivative indicates a rate of change. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The overall instructional goals for an introductory course in calculus for nonmajors do not typically encompass understanding of $\epsilon-\delta$ proofs.

That's because the question itself has a bit of a &quot;blowing off steam&quot; quality to it rather than a &quot;focused on a specific outcome&quot; quality. In a way, that's good. Better that you do that here, because your son's math teacher does not want to be a sounding board for you blowing off steam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In parts, your question seems to want working groups chosen differently, though you don't entirely agree with your son. You also seem to want the teacher not give certain information at a certain time. You also talk about pulling your son out of school. And wanting a letter written to attest to his math knowledge. Is it all of the above?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want something realistic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question is vague on what you expect the teacher to do as a result of your interaction, so I can only guess at what it is you hope will change. The list of things I was able to discern from your question had items that were in conflict with each other, so right off the top I would say to make sure what you want is something the teacher is able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I tell my kids, always ask the person who can actually help you. Likewise, ask for things a person can actually provide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frame your question in a efficient way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here I am assuming your goal is to address what the teacher is teaching.&lt;/em&gt; Whatever class your son is in, there are learning outcomes defined for that class. This is part of what is guiding the teacher. Some of that may be dictated by standards, but an advanced class may go well beyond state standards. Whatever the situation is, you won't know until you talk to the principal or perhaps even the teacher to get some idea of what the end-goal is for the class. If the class goals are different from what you would prefer, it may not entirely be in the teacher's hands. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But my point here is that a better understanding of what you want will help you then seek information to help you frame your question (i.e. in the context of these learning goals for the class, you may be concerned that what your son is currently doing will not help him reach those goals.) Frame the question in a way that helps the teacher respond to you constructively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't talk about your PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Credentials aren't a prerequisite for talking to your son's math teacher. In reality, what does mentioning that actually establish? In some contexts we might mention our credentials to establish a basis for our expertise. But your concern here is as a parent. Your &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; is certainly helpful, but it's helpful to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; and not to the teacher. If the fear is that you will not be taken seriously, your authority is in your status as a parent, not a mathematician. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My point is, examine how you position yourself so that it is focused on smooth communication, a sense of common purpose, and how the teacher can help with the goals you are interested in. If your intention is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to intimidate the teacher, then you want to make certain you are not doing so inadvertently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assume professional expertise / plan for a conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Teachers are constantly challenged as professionals. Their sense of profession is under siege from both parents and policy makers. Be aware of this, because if you say things that indicate you are essentially there to add to the chorus, you'll just sound like the chorus. You want to be someone who has a concern you both can address together constructively. You don't want to be part of a chorus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an accomplished math learner, you may underestimate the role of pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1986) in teaching. The teacher &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; know quite a bit about teaching math that you do not. Hopefully, the teacher also has some understanding of your son's math learning that you do not have. If you're not ready to accept this, then you are going in ready to dictate rather than to have a conversation. Communication is not one way. As you titled your question, you are seeking to &lt;em&gt;interact&lt;/em&gt; with the teacher. You want to tell the teacher something, but the teacher may also have something to tell you. Approach the teacher with your goals, but recognize that the teacher may have suggestions you have not yet considered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally&lt;/strong&gt;, I hope your son has a great high school experience and a smooth transition toward who it is he wants to be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best of luck to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cited:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shulman, L.

From the time complex numbers were first introduced in the 16th century, until Hamilton's reconstruction of the theory in the 19th century, &quot;imaginaries&quot; were generally regarded as a useful fiction, instrumental for the purpose of extracting &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; solutions to problems with &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; quantities in them, but intrinsically meaningless themselves.  It was not until Hamilton introduced what we would now describe as a &quot;vector&quot; framework, showing that the field of complex numbers can be constructed out of real ingredients, that they began to escape their tainted reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One drawback to the approach you suggest is that although you describe the multiplication operation as &quot;fairly natural&quot; -- which I agree it is when points/vectors are represented using polar coordinates -- there is a far more natural multiplication operation when points/vectors are represented in rectangular coordinates, namely $(a,b) \cdot (c,d) = (ac,bd)$, in precise analogy with how vector addition is defined (and I do not think you can plausibly argue that vector addition is best represented in polar coordinates).  In contrast the &quot;correct&quot; definition $(a,b) \cdot (c,d) = (ac-bd,ad+bd)$ is harder to remember and seemingly unmotivated, except in hindsight.  So this approach does away with the &quot;let's pretend&quot; quality of the complexes but at the cost of basing the theory on a seemingly arbitrary multiplication law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, explicitly acknowledging this fact -- that there are at least two different ways one can define multiplication of vectors, one natural and one seemingly arbitrary -- can lead to some interesting investigations.  How &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; different ways can multiplication on $\mathbb{R}^2$ be defined?  What properties do those multiplication laws have?  How many of them are fields?  I still remember how exciting it was when I figured out that the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way to define multiplication on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that yields a field is, up to a change of basis, Hamilton's definition.  It was like a missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle clicked into place.  For me, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is the &quot;motivation&quot; for the complex numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But insight like that can only come to people who already have familiarity with working with these numbers in a less formal way first.  While I certainly do not think as educators we must be slaves to the historical development of a subject, I think there is probably some truth to the idea that Hamilton's insights would not have been possible if they had not been preceded by three centuries of people working formally with numbers whose true &quot;meaning&quot; even the most brilliant mathematicians did not really understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29" LastActivityDate="2014-04-23T15:56:21.540" CommentCount="0" />

This is a teaching style that Eric Mazur of Harvard University Physics pioneered. The class is organized around a series of small lectures that set up conceptual questions that are targeted at common or important misconceptions. Students use the clickers to vote on the questions, then if there's widespread disagreement on the answer (which there usually is if the question is good) the students are put into pairs and tasked to defend their choice to the other person for two minutes. Then students vote again on the same question after they've had a chance to discuss. Quite often, the second round of voting converges either on near-unanimity on the right answer or else it's 50/50.

Scores after all, are the objective goal.  If students don't understand any better, then the immediate goals are more ego-gratification for the professor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, 10 years later, the professor says they use clickers, and find that they still achieve the immediate improvements.  He cannot tell me about grades because they don't do any studies on it.  It is hard to believe that grades cannot improve based on better attendance, but without objective measurement, I still believe their initial impressions which were based on comparison of year on year scores.  Another way of looking at this is that as the studies by the ASU modeling curriculum found, students of physics don't believe what they are writing.  When asked what happens in a &quot;real&quot; situation they give Aristotelian answers.  In other words, the lecturer can improve lecture mechanics with clickers, but unless they change the way they teach, the fundamental scores won't change because the students don't really believe the physics.

The examples/exercise should allow them to develop a sense of when and how it is helpful to simplify an expression in this way, &lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt; also when it is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leading up to it by looking at fractions. Should the students write a rational number in the form $3\frac17$ or $\frac{22}7$? The answer IMHO depends on what you want to do with this number. If it is the final answer to a problem, then in this case either one is probably fine, but in some cases it will be helpful to have the integer part and fractional parts separated, because then you immediately get a good idea of the magnitude, and can answer questions like &quot;Is the answer larger than $3$?&quot; BUT. If this is an intermediate step, then converting $\frac{22}7$ to $3\frac17$ is usually not necessary, and may be a colossal waste of time, if for example the next step in the problem requires you to divide this intermediate result by $11$. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We surely want to teach the students&#xA;the process of converting $3\frac17$ to $\frac{22}7$ and back, not as an end, but as a tool for saying something useful about the answer. We also develop their sense of how fractions and quotients work so that they have a sporting chance to learn to manipulate symbolic fractions later in their studies. But that's a bonus, and difficult to use as motivation at the point when they are learning to manipulate rational numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On with the radicals. IMO the salient questions are &quot;what are we expected to do with this result?&quot; and &quot;can we expect a significant simplification?&quot; Consider the following assignments. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Plot the graph of the function&#xA;$$&#xA;f(x)=\frac{x}{\sqrt2-1}-\frac{x}{\sqrt2+1}&#xA;$$&#xA;by calculating the value of $f(x)$ at the eleven points $x=0, 0.1, 0.2,\ldots, 1.0$. The usefulness of first rationalizing the denominators becomes clear, if the student has developed a sense that there may be significant simplifications lurking in there. Calculating those fractions with a calculator requires several key strokes, properly placed parens et cetera, and is thus error-prone.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The same with a more symbolic expression like&#xA;$$&#xA;g(x)=\frac1{\sqrt x+1}-\frac1{\sqrt x-1}.&#xA;$$&#xA;This is an analogue of the grade school drill of doing a lot of manipulations with fractions, so that it is easier to later learn to manipulate rational functions, when the calculator won't do it for ya.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OTOH, when doing a lot of trigonometry with the usual fractional multiple of $\pi$, you can &quot;almost&quot; treat $1/\sqrt2$ as having a rational denominator. If we are to next square the intermediate result, I doubt anyone would first convert $1/\sqrt2$ to $\sqrt2/2$. I usually won't bother to rationalize that $\sqrt2$ in the denominator myself, so I obviously should not expect my students to do so either.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR; The projected way of using the intermediate result, or the end result, gives hints as to whether an effort in simplification is warranted.

I knew tried showing them how to manipulate matrices with their Ti83. I discovered that they could do the problem with the Ti83 because they had memorized what buttons to press to get the answer but it was more or less like magic to them because they couldn't begin to understand what they trying to do anyway. They just knew to press buttons and fill in the blank. The student was obviously taught to pass not userstand in any way. On the other hand I also had a student who didn't understand how to use the calculator at all. This student was supposed to be comparing very similar graphs and picking out which one is which. I taught to them how to graph and zoom in and out etc. so that they could simply look at the function and postulate various things like intercepts and what direction it's going in. I taught them how to utilize it as a tool not a problem solver. Everything I showed them could be done by hand but doing that on a test with many questions it wouldn't be practical.

To not introduce mathematics students in this century to technology and have them actively using it is just shocking and a great disservice. We should be embracing these tools to provide more legitimate mathematics to our students. Let's take an example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A cookbook problem that exists in a class with no calculators/software could be something (for example) like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solve $x^2-5x+6 = 0 $. And maybe a few of these are necessary to get a feel. However, what is ventured by spending days doing these things by hand with ever more ridiculous problems like $2415x^2+433x-20=0$? That is not a real problem. It comes from nowhere, and no one does these kinds of things without software -- neither mathematician nor applied scientist.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A real problem might result in the cubic $−0.0080556t^3 + 0.11881t^2 − 0.30671t + 3.36$ (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://msemac.redwoods.edu/~kyokoyama/math106/Math380pdf/sect5-3.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, example 1) where we are taking data and fitting a curve. Now I might ask (because this came from data about gasoline prices over time) when the prices were increasing. I can ask that of someone in Algebra 2! Even in Calculus if this is asked, a calculator/software is going to be REQUIRED to find derivatives and arrive at actual numbers. Before Calculus, they can use technology to firstly -- find that cubic(!) with the given data and then discuss what it means.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Point of honesty: Of course I was taught the cookbook stuff!

That just isn't doing (real!) mathematics nor applications justice.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to finish my rant, I would argue that the technology can more quickly allow teachers to introduce students to conjecturing about very hard things more readily than if they don't have such access.

Incidentally, if you look at textbooks written 50 to 150 years ago, you don't really see much of an expectation that radicals were numerically approximated (this view being based on worked examples in the text and answers to exercises), except for trigonometry texts. However, the numerical aspect becomes much more important in applications that occurred &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of mathematics (mainly in science courses), so I suspect what happened is that the training in appropriately rewriting radical expressions so that square root tables and such could be easily used was left to the math courses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally think there has been too much emphasis on rationalizing the denominator in the past 40 years (perhaps in the past 20 years the emphasis has been more appropriate), especially in classes below the precalculus level, but I also think it's easy to forget just how often the technique of rationalization shows up in math, even if we restrict ourselves to the lower undergraduate level. As for me, when departmental and/or course supervisor constraints allowed me to do so, I &lt;strong&gt;DID NOT REQUIRE&lt;/strong&gt; answers to be in denominator-rationalized form in high school or college algebra classes, or in precalculus classes. However, I felt it was an important skill for anyone getting at least as far as calculus. Thus, in calculus courses, I tried to make up for this inattention to rationalization (both by me and by other teachers) by working the topic in at a number of places. I did this mainly by working examples in class and by assigning problems (with an appropriate hint) like #1-6 below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISCELLANEOUS LIST OF EXAMPLES FOR RATIONALIZING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; These limits can be evaluated without taking derivatives if you first apply a binomial rationalization step:&#xA;$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 1}\frac{x^2 - 1}{\sqrt{2x+2\,} \; - \; 2} \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; \lim_{x \rightarrow 0}\frac{1 - \cos x}{x} $$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; To rewrite&#xA;$$ \ln \left( \frac{x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{x - \sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \right) \;\;\; \text{as} \;\;\; 2\ln\left (x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}\right),$$&#xA;it helps if you first rationalize the numerator. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Putting $x = \sec \theta$ gives an identity that is sometimes useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; To differentiate $x^{\frac{1}{2}},$ $x^{\frac{1}{3}},$ etc. using the limit definition of the derivative, you'll want to rationalize numerators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; The derivative of&#xA;$$ \frac{\sqrt{a-x} \; + \; \sqrt{a+x}}{\sqrt{a-x} \; - \; \sqrt{a+x}} $$&#xA;is much easier to put into the more useful form&#xA;$$ \frac{a^2 \; + \; a\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}}{x^2\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;if you rationalize the denominator BEFORE differentiating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; Let $a \neq 0,$ $b,$ and $c$ be real number constants. To verify that&#xA;$$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left( \sqrt{an^2 + bn} \; - \; \sqrt{an^2 + cn} \right) \;\;\; = \;\;\; \frac{1}{2\sqrt{a}}(b-c),$$&#xA;it helps to rationalize the numerator first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; The linearization of&#xA;$$\frac{1+x}{1-x} \;\; \text{at} \;\; x=0$$&#xA;is easy if you begin by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by $1+x.$ After doing this, you get to ignore the $x^2$ terms that appear additively with constants or with multiples of $x.$ The result will be $1 + 2x.$ More generally, rationalization ideas can be used to obtain the quotient rule for derivatives by multiplying/dividing by an appropriate conjugate and ignoring all but first order terms, and similar methods can be used to approximate $f(x+h,\,y+k)$ for rational functions $f(x,y)$ when $h$ and $k$ are close to $0.$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the same way, one can show by rationalization methods that for $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ near $0,$ we have&#xA;$$\frac{1}{1 + \delta} \; \approx \; 1 - \delta \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; \frac{1}{1-\delta} \; \approx \; 1 + \delta \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; \frac{1+\epsilon}{1+\delta} \; \approx \; 1 + \epsilon - \delta $$&#xA;These and other approximations are discussed in Philip L. Alger's 1957 text &lt;strong&gt;Mathematics for Science and Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; (see pp. 145-155 of Chapter 6: &lt;em&gt;Numerical Calculations&lt;/em&gt;) and in William Charles Brenke's 1917 text &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Algebra&lt;/strong&gt; (see Chapter IX, Section 146: &lt;em&gt;Useful Approximations&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 126-127). These approximations are often more important for giving approximations that are valid over a range of variable values than for giving individual and isolated numerical approximations. This is especially useful when an exact algebraic form is difficult to work with, such as in a differential equation (recall the pendulum equation). For instance,&#xA;$$\tanh M \;\; = \;\; \frac{e^{M} \; - \; e^{-M}}{e^{M} \; + \; e^{-M}} \;\; = \;\; \frac{1 \; - \; e^{-2M}}{1 \; + \; e^{-2M}} \;\; \approx \;\; 1 - 2e^{-2M}$$&#xA;is an approximation that is correct to $16$ decimal places when $M = 10.$ This particular approximation for $\tanh M$ is obtained in the same manner I've just shown, and then used to find the lowest eigenvalue in the high barrier limit for a quantum mechanical particle confined to a double potential well, in Charles S. Johnson and Lee G. Pedersen's 1974 &lt;strong&gt;Problems and Solutions in Quantum Chemistry and Physics&lt;/strong&gt; (see Problem 4.8(b) on pp. 105-106).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example can be found in Jerry B. Marion's 1970 text &lt;strong&gt;Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems&lt;/strong&gt; (see p. 270). Marion uses the approximation&#xA;$$\theta \;\; = \;\; \frac{2\pi}{1 - \frac{\delta}{\alpha}} \;\; \approx \;\; 2\pi\left(1 + \frac{\delta}{\alpha}\right) \;\; = \;\; 2\pi + \frac{2\pi\delta}{\alpha}$$&#xA;near the end of a derivation of the precession of Mercury's orbit as predicted by Einstein's Theory of Relativity. The term $\frac{2\pi\delta}{\alpha}$ represents the approximate precession per orbit, which in Mercury's case works out to approximately $43$ seconds (angle measure) per century.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; To express the quotient of two complex numbers in rectangular form, when each of the complex numbers is given in rectangular form, you'll want to use a &quot;rationalization of the denominator&quot; technique. Related to this is finding the real and imaginary parts of a rational function of a complex variable (e.g. verifying the Cauchy-Riemann equations, finding a harmonic conjugate of a rational function, investigating certain orthogonal families of curves, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; For numerical purposes (e.g. reducing round-off errors during a computer computation), the quadratic formula&#xA;$$ x \;\; = \;\; \frac{-b \; \pm \; \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$&#xA;is in some cases more usefully expressed as&#xA;$$ x \;\; = \;\; \frac{2c}{-b \; \pm \; \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; To show that ${\mathbb Q}[\sqrt{2}]$ (i.e. real numbers of the form $r + s\sqrt{2}$ where $r$ and $s$ are rational numbers) is a field, a  &quot;rationalization of the denominator&quot; technique is useful when verifying the multiplicative inverse part of the definition of a field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; Rationalizing techniques are useful to obtain non-radical forms for the general equation of a hyperbola and an ellipse directly from their geometric definitions. Related to this is the general idea of rationalizing an algebraic equation (say, for an algebraic curve or an algebraic surface -- see Cayley's 1868 paper &lt;em&gt;On Polyzomal Curves, otherwise the Curves&lt;/em&gt; $\sqrt{U} + \sqrt{V} +$ &amp;amp;c. $=0,$ which begins on p. 470 &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=-5dQAAAAYAAJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for some eye-opening stuff) and of solving radical equations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.&lt;/strong&gt; It is easy to find a simple expression for the following sum if each denominator is rationalized:&#xA;$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1} + \sqrt{2}} \; + \; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}} \; + \;\frac{1}{\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{4}} \; + \; \cdots \; + \; \frac{n}{\sqrt{n} + \sqrt{n+1}}$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="745" LastActivityDate="2014-04-25T18:58:13.107" CommentCount="0" />

I do something similar for second-semester students especially if most of them were not in my class the previous semester.  For a precalculus class, I may stress the points below throughout the semester.  For a Calculus II class, I adapt myself according to their performance.  I should note that when I say I teach them to learn effectively, I recognize that it took me a long time to learn how to learn and it might take most of my students a few years, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have several things I try to tell them at opportune times.  When possible, I tell it through a story.  It helps to have an interesting roommate in college, or to have made mistakes yourself when you were a college student.  I usually say such things at the beginning of class, and limit it to one thing per class.  Some of the things I say are appropriate for everyone and some moreso for a student who is struggling with something.  In the latter case, I might say those things only in person.  It's good to have a balance of positive and negative examples.  Positive seems better, but sometimes a warning example is the best you can do, especially if a few students might might recognize themselves in the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The important thing is to give advice when the students are receptive to it.  Sometimes a student will ask something in class that is a perfect lead-in to one of the points.  A few of the topics are meant to prepare the students for advice.  For instance the  &quot;work versus effort&quot; discussion and the biology of learning below establish terms for discussion I can use throughout the course.  One of the times you will have their greatest attention is the day you hand back the first test.  (For that reason, I think it is good to have an early test, around three weeks into the term, while there is still time for the student to adjust.)  It is important that I have the terms in place before I have that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I am trying to get them to change their habits, it takes a lot more than just telling them what to do and what not to do.  It helps to get them to recognize that their habits need improvement.  It also takes a lot of reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below, I have put the words I say to the class or student in quotes, more or less as I might say it.  Occasionally discussion or comments will appear outside the quotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work versus effort.&lt;/em&gt;  &quot;In physics, work is the product of the component of force applied in the direction of motion.  For instance, when you move a heavy object, the work done is proportional to the distance the object is raised.  If you carry a 100 lb. object across the quad, it takes a lot of effort, but you do no work if the object is not raised.  Learning takes work and effort.  You want to raise the level of your understanding standing.  You want as much as possible your efforts to be efficient and result in work accomplished.&quot;  Not all my students know physics, so this needs a brief explanation such as I wrote above.  I usually tell this a week or two into the term and well before the first test.  Then I remind them right after the first test before they get the scores back.  &quot;If you find that your performance wasn't as good as you wanted, you might consider how effective your study habits have been.  What you did, did it get the work done?  If you have questions or concerns, come see me.  I know lots of good strategies for studying and can help you.&quot;  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning takes work.&lt;/em&gt;  &quot;Learning alters the neural networks in the brain, and the alteration takes energy.  It really does take work in the sense of physics.&quot;  This might be what I say the day after the work versus effort story.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How learning happens.&lt;/em&gt; &quot;When a neural network is formed, it is connected to other networks, other knowledge.  There is a process of forgetting that naturally occurs in which the new network becomes less likely to be activated unless it is used.  The more it is used the more easily it is activated.  More networks form around it as our understanding deepens.  One of the more powerful ways to reinforce this new knowledge is when it is used to create motor activity.&quot;  Some teachers are creative and make up dances or other physical activity.  &quot;Writing out the solution to a problem is motor activity. So is illustrating the solution with a graph.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Practice.&lt;/em&gt;  &quot;The primary way to learn mathematics is to practice solving problems.&quot;  I tell them several times.  I can connect it to the description of how learning happens above when appropriate. &quot;Once you learn how to solve a problem, practice solving problems the way you will be tested -- without resources, writing complete solutions.  When you don't need to look things up, you will know that you know how to do it.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recall.&lt;/em&gt;  &quot;The effort to recall reinforces knowledge and makes it easier to recall it.  Trying to recall it in different situations helps, too.  You can trying recalling things on the way to the cafeteria, say the derivative rules,&quot; or how to solve a type of problem, or a proof, etc., according to what's appropriate to the course.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memorization.&lt;/em&gt;  &quot;A carpenter does not plan to build a house by saying that whenever a hammer is needed, he or she can run down to the community center and rent one.  If you're going to build solutions to problems, you have to have the appropriate tools at hand.  You'll have to decide what needs to be memorized -- I'll give you hints when I think something is important.  In mathematics it is much less than, say, in foreign language or some science courses.  The best way to do it is in short, frequent, intensive intervals; then less and less frequently.  Pick two times each day some hours apart and practice, with flash cards if you like, for fifteen minutes.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memory and understanding.&lt;/em&gt;  &quot;Memory is unreliable, at least my recall of facts is.  It is easy to switch the facts around, get a minus sign wrong, and so forth.  There are a couple things you can do to help.  If you understanding &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, then that can be used to check.  Another is to learn a way to check.&quot;  (For instance, for the sign of the derivatives of sine and cosine, in the first quadrant, the sine is increasing and the cosine is decreasing.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repetition.&lt;/em&gt;  &quot;Sometimes it is more important to repeat a problem than to work a new one.&quot;  When a student has struggled to work through a problem, I say, &quot;Now what I would like you to do is later tonight or perhaps tomorrow, work the problem again and see if you have learned how to do it.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing that you have learned.&lt;/em&gt; In response to when a student says, &quot;I don't know why I did poorly&quot;: &quot;Did you work the review problems alone and unaided by the textbook and your notes?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being prepared for the test.&lt;/em&gt;  (1) &quot;What do you think is the most important thing to do to be prepared for the test?&quot;  (Wait for their answers.  You'll get an insight into some of your students, and generally you find out they know half the things you would tell them -- at least, they know what to say.)  My answer: &quot;To show up.  You're not prepared to take the test if you're not there.&quot;  Then I work back from that to the things it implies, such as getting a good night's sleep, etc.  (2) &quot;Be prepared to take the test the day before it is offered.  If you wake up and, nightmare!, the test was that day, you should be able to do a good job.  If for some reason there is something you still have trouble with, then you have another day to figure it out.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Help each other.&lt;/em&gt;  &quot;Forming habits is easier when your friends are doing it, too.  And learning, especially learning difficult material, is easier when your friends are doing it, too.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning how versus learning to study.&lt;/em&gt;  It is relatively easy to learn the words of the answer to the question, &quot;How should you study?&quot;  It is harder to learn to make it part of one's habitual practice.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Positive attitude.&lt;/em&gt;  It is particularly important that the teacher have faith that the students can do it.  Students can sense sincerity.  Forming or breaking habits is difficult and the student will have to do it for himself or herself.  It took me until junior (3rd) year of college to feel that I had formed good habits and knew how to learn effectively. I tell that to my students.  I emphasize that they need to be patient with themselves and they will improve.  If they continue improving, they will become excellent. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about these things several years ago, when a good student, one who had won a scholarship, came to me and said she was surprised by the questions on the test and they were not what she expected.  I said, &quot;Well, let's look at the test.  Maybe I made a mistake.&quot;  So we went through the test and quickly summarized what each problem was about.  Then I said, &quot;Now, let's look at the syllabus.&quot;  It corresponded exactly with the test.  She said, &quot;Wait!  It's that's simple?!&quot;  It made me start paying closer attention to what the students do not know about going to college/university.  Last fall, another student, even more highly qualified, earned a D on the first test in Calculus II and came to me for advice.  On the next test, he made only one minor error.  When I returned the test, he exclaimed out loud, &quot;Oh my gosh! Studying pays off.&quot;  My colleagues often have a &quot;Well, duh&quot; response, but to me it shows just what the teacher needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me recommend again the physics-based description work versus effort.  Such gimmicks often have varied success in the hands of a variety of people, but this one has been effective for me.  I do not get far fewer complaints about how hard the student tried; rather, they say, &quot;I put in a lot of effort, but I still did bad.  What can I do to improve?&quot;  First, I think that is where their attention should be.  And second, asking for help is so much more pleasant, both for me and for them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Helping people change their behavior requires patience.  I know the above helps some -- I would say most of my students this year -- and would help all.  There are always students struggling with personal issues.

Similarly, Horn and Nunez (2000) report that students whose parents never attended college are more than twice as likely to enroll in four-year colleges if they take courses beyond advanced algebra; and Carnevale &amp;amp; Desrochers (2003) found that “Algebra II is the threshold mathematics course taken by people who eventually get good jobs in the top half of the earnings distribution”, despite the fact that relatively few actually make use of that mathematical knowledge on the job.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I realize that these studies focus on economic outcomes, rather than &quot;understanding, analytic ability etc&quot; as you asked, but I think this is the closest you are likely to get in terms of measurable benefit to students.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However -- and this is a huge caveat -- these results show a &lt;em&gt;correlation&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;causation&lt;/em&gt;, and the question you ask is probably impossible to answer.

I think the despair of the teachers to show them that mathematics is useful has driven them to this kind of examples. But, it doesn't stop in primary school, linearity is almost always assumed. I think I even saw questions in mathematics and physics courses where you had to assume linearity to solve the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now linearity is not a bad thing (even if the thing we are trying to compute isn't exactly linearly we can still use it as an approximation), but the hidden assumption of it is a bad thing. Students will get confused and assume things are linear when they don't.

You can use this to facilitate a discussion about, first of all, the convergence of these ratios $\frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n}\to\varphi$, and also about how the accuracy of the conversion gets better with larger $n$.

Subject area content knowledge (as mentioned in the question) is of some importance, as well as generalized pedagogical knowledge (reflecting the general knowledge about what it means to be a good teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, Shulman (1986) identified other forms of knowledge important to teaching. For example, Pedagogical Content Knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A second  kind  of  content &#xA;  knowledge  is  pedagogical knowledge,  which  goes  beyond  knowledge &#xA;  of  subject  matter per  se  to  the  dimension  of  subject  matter &#xA;  knowledge  for  teaching.  I  still  speak  of  content  knowledge&#xA;  here,  but  of  the  particular  form  of content  knowledge  that &#xA;  embodies  the  aspects  of  content  most germane  to  its &#xA;  teachability. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of representation is an important form of PCK. For example, a mathematician may not need to know the sorts of visual models that help a 4th grader grasp aspects of ratio and proportion as a part of their learning fractions (as opposed to teaching them to manipulate fractions).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Within  the  category  of  pedagogical  content  knowledge  I  in- &#xA;  clude,  for  the  most  regularly  taught  topics  in  one's  subject&#xA;  area,  the  most  useful  forms  of  representation  of  those  ideas,&#xA;  the  most powerful  analogies, illustrations,  examples, &#xA;  explanations,  and  demonstra-  tions-in  a  word,  the  ways  of &#xA;  representing  and  formulating  the  subject  that  make  it &#xA;  comprehensible  to  others. (p. 9)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; knowledge of students. There is legitimate mathematical content knowledge that is more important for teaching than it is for doing mathematics. For instance, few mathematicians have a reason to distinguish between quotative and partitive division. Yet they are distinct mathematical conceptions of division that also happen to make it easier to understand how young students see division. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.learner.org/courses/learningmath/number/session4/part_a/division.html&quot;&gt;This page goes into some detail on the difference between these conceptions, including a video example of work with a student.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shulman also discussed &quot;Curricular Knowledge&quot; which specifically refers to instructional materials (and would be of little interest to experts in the subject area). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers focusing on teacher knowledge have broken the categories down further. Hill, Ball, and Schilling (2008) proposed an overall domain map known now as &quot;MKT&quot; (Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching). There is some evidence linking forms of knowledge described in this model to classroom practice (Shechtman, Roschelle, Haertel, &amp;amp; Knudsen, 2010). It breaks down into many, very specific, categories that researchers continue to investigate (Common Content Knowledge, Specialized Content Knowledge, Knowledge at the Mathematical Horizon, Knowledge of Content and Students, Knowledge of Content and Teaching, and Knowledge of Curriculum).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even more recently, Schoenfeld has asked questions about how teachers make decisions (2010) and how we should observe the quality of a particular mathematics classroom based on what we see going on there (2013). The latter has resulted in a theoretical model of classroom quality involving multiple dimensions that are related to what he sees as going into educational decision-making (teacher knowledge, teacher orientations, routines, etc.). Not surprisingly, the classroom itself is quite a bit more complex than what goes into teacher decision making. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case mathematical content knowledge is distinct from what makes a good math teacher. Others in their responses here have covered the idea that expertise sometimes makes it harder to actually bridge a communication gap in understanding (referred to by @adamblan as a blind spot). The differences go well beyond that, and even beyond knowledge of students and teaching. Some of the references here should help you delve into how researchers investigate (and have theorized about) the differences eluded to in your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cited:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hill, H.

These are a couple of good ones that were missed.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Combinatorics&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Fibonacci sequence is the number of strings of characters of length $n$, containing only &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, where two &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;'s cannot be consecutive. For $n=4$ there are $8$ strings for example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;abab abba abbb baba babb bbab bbba bbbb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Relation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another nice factoid is that $F_{n-1} F_{n+1} = F_n^2 + (-1)^n$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This relation, and lots of other nice ones, including the limiting behavior, follow from the closed form &#xA;$$ F_n = \phi_1^n + \phi_2^n $$&#xA;where $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are the two solutions to $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$ (and the positive one of these is the usual 'golden ratio' $\phi$).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solving the recursion to find this closed form is neat and not too complicated, although it does require fluency with algebraic manipulation, and some tricky concepts. If you can do this, you can see why all Fibonacci sequences, regardless of the first two numbers, have the same limiting ratio between two adjacent terms, and how all the closed forms are related.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to find the closed form, you can probably still obtain the relation, just using the recursive definition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Phi&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The irrational number which can be least well approximated by fractions of a given size of denominator, is $\phi$. The best approximations at any size are given by $\frac{F_n}{F_{n-1}}$. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For most irrational numbers, if you try to find fractions which are close to that number, but whose denominator is not too big, you occasionally stumble across fractions which are much close than the 'average'. Eg $\pi$ can be written approximately as $\frac{3}{1}$, $\frac{22}{7}$, and then $\frac{355}{113}$. The last one is much, much better than you would hope for - the error is one over 5 million whereas you should statistically only expect an error of one in a few tens of thousands, for a denominator of that size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With $\phi$ you never 'get lucky' - fractional approximations, even the best possible fractional approximations, always fall roughly the expected distance away from $\phi$. They also alternate between too big and too small.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To fully understand the math behind this, you have to learn about &lt;em&gt;continued fractions&lt;/em&gt;, which are extremely interesting, but probably off-topic for your class. The math is not very difficult, but it's not the kind of thing you can explain in a 10 minute parenthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Pseudo-mathematics&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot (perhaps most) of what is claimed about the Fibonacci sequence and the (very closely related) Golden Ratio is bogus. A nice paper is here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.dur.ac.uk/bob.johnson/fibonacci/miscons.pdf&quot;&gt;http://community.dur.ac.uk/bob.johnson/fibonacci/miscons.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some pointers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Natural world&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Fibonacci sequence has a pretend real-world justification, in terms of rabbits reproducing. No-one sensible has ever claimed that these number were observed in real rabbit populations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Fibonacci sequence does appear in some plant physiology, notably numbers of branches, petals and seeds for certain plants. There are some good reasons for this: some plants branch in simple ways which are analogous to the 'rabbit family trees'. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some of these patterns also involve the 'Fibonacci spiral', eg sunflower heads. This has a slightly more complex mathematical justification, which is not at all controversial.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lots of people have found Fibonacci numbers, the golden ratio and Fibonacci spirals in many, many natural objects. Most of these claims are either coincidence or deliberate (perhaps unconscious) mismeasurement (unless the universe works very, very differently to the way most scientists think it does).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Examining 'fringe' claims&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some of these people are just on the wrong track, or doing something of interest to them which isn't quite mathematics or science, some of them are probably insane. It's often hard to tell papers written by these people apart from serious writing about the links between mathematics and say, zoology.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some of them might be right, and have spotted observed something about the mathematics of say, a zebra's stripes, that wasn't previously known to professionals. What is very unlikely is that all of these claims are true.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Golden ratio is probably the worst offender. If you make enough different measurements of parts of an object, you are pretty certain to find close approximations to any ratio you care to choose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finding small values from the Fibonacci sequence (such as 5 or 8) is another common trick.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some writing which purports to find several occurrences of $\phi$ or the Fibonacci sequence in a given natural object, actually finds one such occurrence, and then transforms it in various simple mathematical ways and claims that these are independent observations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The ratio of the side to the diagonal of a pentagon is $\phi$. Natural objects with fivefold symmetry (some fruit, starfish) will probably contain the golden ratio without this meaning much, except that they have fivefold symmetry.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Art and culture&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some historical and contemporary architects, artists and designers have intentionally used $\phi$ or the Fibonacci sequence. The most famous example is the Parthenon in Athens.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some of these people believed that these ratios and numbers were specially beautiful, some that they had some kind of mystic power, and some were playing around with interesting math.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some of the intentional use by artists might have degenerated into the belief that the numbers are present in physical objects. For example, artists might have chosen to use $\phi$ for the ratio of navel height to height when drawing figures, and this might have led people later to believe that this exact ratio actually occurs in all humans.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As with natural objects, it has also been claimed that $\phi$ and Fibonacci appear in almost all buildings, paintings, sculptures and music in various disguised or non-disguised forms. Much of the 'evidence' of this works the same way as with natural objects - measure many different parts of a painting, and work out all the ratios until you find the ones you want.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no evidence that our brain is wired to select these patterns unconsciously or to find them especially beautiful.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nor is there a scientific consensus that $\phi$ and Fibonacci are ubiquitous in all human endeavour at all times in history because of divine inspiration, secret knowledge handed down by aliens, or an extremely wide-reaching conspiracy. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you discuss this with your students you will probably hear a lot of the bogus claims above which have passed in the popular consciousness, partly as a result of 'The Da Vinci Code'. I think examining these is great math. Depending on how focussed on your syllabus you have to be, you might be able to discuss some or all of the following with your class:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How accurate does the ratio between a person's height and the height of their belly button have to be, before we can be sure that it is $1.618$ and not $1.638$ or $1.5922$? Is the related claim that the height of the belly button and the vertical distance between the top of the head and the belly button are in the same ratio further evidence, or is it redundant? How many people should we measure? How many daisies should we count petals of to decide if only Fibonacci numbers appear, and how close to the exact numbers do we need to be? What signs within a math paper and from its context should we examine to decide if it can be trusted? Is the distinction between mainstream math and pseudo-mathematics valid or is pseudo-mathematics just mathematics by people outside the mainstream?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might or might not be interested in talking to your class about this. I had some success when students in a Calc I class asked me about appearances of $\pi$ in Egyptian pyramids.

But, assuming you have available the analytical grades and not just the statistics:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the specific example, questions are distinguished  by their &lt;em&gt;maximum value&lt;/em&gt; &quot;PtsPossible&quot;. So they are different objects, because they have a possibly different range -the &quot;maximum points awarded&quot; are not necessarily the same (even though the variability is not large). Now, you may have a detailed analysis and discussion to offer about the &quot;difficulty&quot; of each answer (importance, length of requirements to answer, nature of the question etc etc), but &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankly,_my_dear,_I_don%27t_give_a_damn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;frankly my dear I don't give a damn&quot;&lt;/a&gt; :) -no matter what your considerations were, for my distant statistical eyes, you synthesized them and compacted them all in one single value - the &quot;PtsPossible&quot; per question.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Although this ranking is important, for the moment, &quot;standardize&quot; your data to make the grades comparable:&#xA;Express the grading of each answer by each student as a percentage of the maximum points that the specific question gives. You have transformed your sample into &quot;relative achievement scores&quot; (or whatever you want to call it). Then recalculate the descriptive statistics of your sample. Now all your data range in 0-1 (or 0-100%), and now they are comparable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now use the fact that each question has a different maximum value: order the questions ranking them by their &quot;PtsPossible&quot;, and see whether the descriptive statistics follow the same pattern  (e.g. the more &quot;valuable&quot; the question the higher the average relative achievement), or the inverse pattern, or no pattern at all. Although at this level of aggregation you have only 7 data points (the 7 &quot;PtsPossible&quot; and the 7 values of each descriptive statistic), you can calculate their correlation coefficient. Even better,  graph the 7-point series of PtsPossible pair-wise with each series of a descriptive statistic in a X-Y scatter-plot, to see visually whether there is a clear linear or non-linear association. If there is an association, how can you interpret it? E.g., if more valuable questions exhibit &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; variability in the grades (e.g. lower st.dev.), it is an indication that you have designed the test so that the students had a relatively easy day... Is that so? etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Create histograms with bars of length 0.05 or 0.1 for each question and look at them -are they unimodal, bimodal? Unimodal shapes will tell you that students are relatively more homogeneous regarding their knowledge/performance, compared to a question whose answer grades have a bimodal histogram. Does this accords with, or contradicts, any related opinion you had prior to the test?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Get &lt;em&gt;centered&lt;/em&gt; visual insights: subtract from all data points the relevant sample mean (per question), obtaining a zero-mean data sample. Create here too histograms, and graph together, not the bars, but all the lines that each connects the middle point of each bar (i.e a simple empirical &quot;probability density function&quot; for each question), for this data sample. You will immediately see whether they more or less &quot;look the same&quot; or whether some have a visibly different shape, &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; being confused by possible different mean values. This will tell you immediately whether the distribution of the questions differ in terms of skewness, i.e. you will obtain visually the information that the comparison between mean and median usually gives.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you will be doing all these, your brain will start to combine the new information with the presumably good knowledge you have about the intricacies of each question, as well as about your students -and conclusions will emerge, usually richer than &quot;which question was the hardest&quot;.

One good and interactive activity could be to divide the class into four 'teams' (or more) and pick one member from each team and line them up at the front. The remaining folks in each team take it in turn to say a number larger than 12 (or some larger number) and the lined up folks have to count up to that number always going from left to right. The team scores points if they get the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; number called out to land on their player. Eventually it should crystallise that it is only the &lt;em&gt;remainder&lt;/em&gt; that counts and that numbers $4n + r$ and $4m+s$ are essentially the same in this context if $r=s.$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could be extended by saying that now, instead of always starting from the leftmost player in the line-up, you carry on counting from the last player who spoke a number in each round. This should get them thinking about modular addition. I'm sure you could imagine loads of variations/extensions of this game. There are probably a few 'hacks' in this game where students can bypass thinking about modularity, but so long as there is a good discussion which explicitly brings these strategies to the fore afterwards I think it would be quite fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some form of imagery such as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/sh8B4.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;could be good to bring the point home visually because the 'groups of four' just go together to make more groups of four. Depends on their level but this could quite easily lead to some algebra.

While &quot;trivial&quot; has connotations of &quot;exceptionally easy&quot;, in math speak we often use it to roughly mean &quot;an exceptionally simple statement, requiring little complexity to prove or define&quot;. I'd probably shy away from &quot;the proof is trivial&quot; a little more, but even so, if it's a tiny 3 line lemma, even if it's not easy and involves a huge leap of logic, it's still &quot;trivial&quot; by my metric.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I view &quot;trivial&quot; like &quot;simple&quot;, and &quot;simple doesn't mean easy&quot; is practically a catch phrase of mine at this point. Things can be simple in that they only rely on two or three axiomatic facts, but actually thinking of which two or three axioms to use isn't always easy. It may pay off to remind students of this fact. &quot;It's not exceptionally complex, but can be hard to understand&quot; goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basic is the next I'd be okay with, but only in limited cases. I'd pretty much solely use &quot;basic&quot; to refer to things like so-called &quot;basic facts&quot; (2+2=4; you can't divide by zero, etc), or more generally literal axioms of the system you're working in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Obviously&quot; and &quot;clearly&quot; I'd avoid at all costs, unless &lt;strong&gt;maybe&lt;/strong&gt; you're saying &quot;2+2=4&quot;.

Please excuse my bluntness. I will try to give you the opinion you ask for by weighing what I think may be most important relative to quality of math education. Black and white is not my usual style.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you say &quot;Common Core&quot; you must, primarily, be referring to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.corestandards.org/&quot;&gt;Common Core State Standards&lt;/a&gt; (CCSS). And in this context, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.corestandards.org/Math/&quot;&gt;Common Core State Standards for Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; (CCSS-M)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;, it is not the end of the world. &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;, it is (or should be) the beginning of an &lt;em&gt;improvement in the practice of math education&lt;/em&gt; here in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY?&lt;/strong&gt; The shortest answer as to why this is definitely an improvement lies in the CSS-MP, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/&quot;&gt;practices portion of the Common Core State Standards&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the CCSS-M include a list of eight practices which, as a math person, you would likely recognize as good mathematical habits of mind related to the sense-making aspect of mathematics. Summarized, they are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Problem solving and perseverence&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Quantitative reasoning&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mathematical argumentation (reasoning and proof)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mathematical modeling with data&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Strategic use of tools (representations, technology, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Attention to appropriate precision in calculation, communication, claims, definitions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Seek and make use of structure&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Generalize from repeated reasoning&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Some may not like my summaries, so it's best just to look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/&quot;&gt;the descriptions themselves&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is the case that not all states had these practices (or the notion of an explicit focus on mathematical practices) in mind in their existing frameworks and standards. So, this standardizes the recognition that there should be an explicit focus on these aspects of mathematical thinking in mathematics education &lt;em&gt;rather than&lt;/em&gt; standards simply existing as a list of what content comes in what order and hoping that the students develop good habits of mind along the way. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/21317961&quot;&gt;Here you can listen to Prof. Alan Schoenfeld briefly make a similar argument.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This may not be the argument you hear most often in defense of the CCSS. There is the general defense of standardization, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/51933492&quot;&gt;described in this short video&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ies.ed.gov/&quot;&gt;IES&lt;/a&gt; noticed great variability in the quality of education from state to state. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/&quot;&gt;NAEP testing&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the states had varying expectations, the results of which were only uncovered in NAEP testing done across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is an important issue in itself, but in the potential CCSS-M has for improving math instruction, I see the mathematical practices as their best contribution. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOW&lt;/strong&gt; - These are &lt;em&gt;standards&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;curriculum&lt;/em&gt;. For political reasons, it was important to not dictate curriculum or specific pedagogy. Therefore, how a state adopts these standards, what curriculum they choose, and whether they put any effort toward supporting teachers in doing what is necessary to develop students' mathematical habits of mind is a local decision. And it is a decision with fiscal and other resource implications. There are some serious political implications here that I will not divert into. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt; to that part of your question, though states and districts will have to take the practice standards to heart, lead teachers to &lt;a href=&quot;http://map.mathshell.org/materials/stds.php&quot;&gt;appropriate formative assessment lessons&lt;/a&gt; that both develop student mathematical reasoning and help teachers determine their students' progress in that development. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why do I &quot;hear all sorts of stories ... horror stories mostly ... about the Common Core math curriculum?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the reason you're hearing &quot;Common Core math curriculum&quot; because there is curriculum that claims to be &quot;aligned with the common core.&quot; The actual problems you may see with this curriculum may have nothing to do with the standards. You may even be seeing problems arising from a misinterpretation of what the standards call for. Or a pedagogy that does little to encourage the practices, but it claimed to be aligned simply because it took a traditional approach and mapped it to the content standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, you could also be seeing an actual attempt to help students reason in some way aligned with one or more of the practices, but at an appropriate grade level. For instance, before students can do formal proving, they may be developing an understanding of the role of justification in mathematical reasoning, and engage in informal proving and argumentation. Students may well be asked to do things that their parents simply do not recognize as mathematics because they were never asked to, for example, reason quantitatively (Smith III &amp;amp; Thompson, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why have I maybe heard &quot;that it's better for the smart kids but it's elitist?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm actually not sure. I haven't actually heard this. It is possible that some are worried that higher standards, in some cases will cause test scores to temporarily drop. That may well be the case. But a period of transition may not be able to avoid this, and the point is really the learning, not the scores themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other attacks are there on the CCSS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some see it&lt;/em&gt; as a &lt;strong&gt;states rights&lt;/strong&gt; issue. But you asked about education, and I think &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is the appropriate focus, unless it is a discussion among lawyers, which can happen elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some want more &lt;strong&gt;local control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the content standards. Today, a wise math ed researcher I know pointed out that the NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics takes a wider grade-band approach, which would have given states, districts, and teachers more flexibility in their local use of the standards. My &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; opinion is that a desire to hold individual teachers accountable within a school year (i.e. the ability to use standardized assessments to apply a Value Added Model to teacher evaluation) is embedded in these standards and some of the standardized assessments that are being developed. This is something I wish they'd change about the standards (and something I think they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; change). Combine grades into bands and hand some flexibility to the states. But I'm not in charge of them. And I see the presence of the mathematical practices to be more significant in possibly improving instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some are disturbed by all the &lt;strong&gt;standardized testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that is going on. This is reflected in &lt;a href=&quot;http://truthinamericaneducation.com/common-core-assessments/what-states-have-pulled-out-of-their-common-core-assessment-consortium/&quot;&gt;some states that have withdrawn from the common core-aligned assessments&lt;/a&gt;. I will note that this is not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; related to the question about improving math instruction, however, it definitely could be depending on how districts change their schools to prepare for tests. It is understandable that a burden of test preparation is a serious concern for teachers, and it is also understandable that it has so often been conflated with the standards themselves (we call them standardized tests, after all, and they are definitely related). However, getting rid of the CCSS-M wouldn't stop standardized testing. In that sense, attacking Common Core State Standards because of issues over testing is barking up the wrong tree. This is a bad thing because it won't lead to desired results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think there are no publications on this yet, but there are people &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smarterbalanced.org/smarter-balanced-assessments/&quot;&gt;working on providing tests that score along multiple dimensions&lt;/a&gt; and help teachers gain an understanding of how to help their students rather than just one score that will be used to evaluate teacher performance. And there are people working to provide materials that help teachers &quot;teach to the test&quot; in a way that develops mathematical reasoning rather than just developing a higher score on the test. That sort of thing is possibly coming in the near future. But it depends on the type of tests states adopt. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. There are people who fundamentally disagree with certain research-based approaches to math education, preferring a more traditional didactic approach. &lt;a href=&quot;http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/a/1461/759&quot;&gt;See my previous answer here&lt;/a&gt; for just one thread of research that shows how there are multiple dimensions to mathematics education, and implications in traditional approaches that we did not realize were interfering with both math learning and with how students decided to go on to further study in math and related fields. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are political wars that buffet math education, and math wars (Schoenfeld, 2004) that have produced political movements to quash certain kinds of curriculum and instruction reforms. Some of these people tour the country to fan the fires of their complaints, knowing that parents showing up at school boards has been effective for them in the past in opposing the kind of instruction reform they disagree with. While I respect differences of opinion, I cannot always say I respect the political approach to winning this sort of debate, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stanford.edu/~joboaler/#sthash.cwuj2cDB&quot;&gt;other, even less noble, approaches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Long story short, some of this stuff will also show up on social media because some people are specifically attacking Common Core State Standards as the new manifestation of reform they have long opposed. Ironically, many of the reformers they oppose would not have written the standards this way. They're very much a compromise. I wanted to include this information mainly to explain that there is another motivation out there for some of these attacks/complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not gone into legitimate, educational complaints about the CCSS-M (other than the grade band issue) mainly because you asked for an opinion and I have provided the arguments to explain my opinion.

Mort aux triangles!&quot; (see King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry by Siobhan Roberts, p. 157), often associated in the popular mind with Bourbaki's general stance on rigorous, formalized mathematics (eschewing pictorial representations, etc.).

These ideas were influential, and Euclidean Geometry was gradually demoted in French secondary school education. Not totally abolished though: it is still a part of the syllabus, but without the difficult and interesting proofs and the axiomatic foundation. Analogous demotion/abolition of EG took place in most European countries during the 70s and 80s, especially in the Western European ones. (An exception is Russia!) And together with EG there was a gradual disappearance of mathematical proofs from the high school syllabus, in most European countries; the trouble being (as I understand it) that most of the proofs and notions of modern mathematical areas which replaced EG either required maturity or were not sufficiently interesting to students, and gradually most of such proofs were abandoned. About ten years later, there were general calls that geometry return, as the introduction of the alternative mathematical areas did not produce the desired results. Thus EG came back, but not in its original form. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I teach in a University (not a high school), and we keep introducing new introductory courses, for math majors, as our new students do not know what a proof is. [Cf. the rise of university courses in the US that come under the heading &quot;Introduction to Mathematical Proofs&quot; and the like.] &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am interested in hearing arguments both FOR and AGAINST the return of EG to high school curricula. Some related questions: is it necessary for high-school students to be exposed to proofs?

Some related questions: is it necessary for high-school students to be exposed to proofs?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am going to address part of this question, specifically the changing role of the notion of proof as it appears in standards (influenced by research). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My brief response borrows heavily from the document I am referencing (Yackel &amp;amp; Hanna, 2003); by responding I intend to connect your question to something underlying the inclusion of mathematical practices (and/or mathematical processes) in recent standards documents here in the USA. This inclusion is based on mathematics education theory. I do not address arguments for including Euclidean geometry and geometric proofs as curriculum content. As proof and proving are not my particular area, I am hoping that what I can provide here points you towards research and arguments that help you address the part of your question that is tied to &quot;proofs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many math ed researchers tightly associate learning and reasoning (see a quote from Thompson in Yackel &amp;amp; Hanna, 2003, p. 227). Von Glasersfeld (the prominent theorist) &quot;posited that knowledge is built up by the cognizing individual (2003, p. 227).&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The importance placed on mathematical reasoning in the learning process has been embraced by some recent research-based approaches to math education, Being able to communicate &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you know something now becomes an inherent part of mathematics instruction (and classroom activity for both teachers and students). Therefore, at all levels, argumentation and justification become a practice that must be suffused throughout the curriculum rather than a specific content target for a particular grade band. This is not only true for the NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000), but also for the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.corestandards.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Common Core State Standards&lt;/a&gt; with their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;section on mathematical practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will find some research-based justifications for this approach to standards-based education in the Yackel and Hanna (2003) chapter. A more recent book (Stylianou, Blanton, &amp;amp; Knuth, 2009) also provides insights into how research informs the inclusion of proof throughout the grades, and as early as kindergarten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this acts as a decent starting point to sources that argue strongly for proof as a mathematical practice, which would provide a foundation for secondary-level proof and proving that might be more recognizable in traditional curricula. Yackel and Hanna (2003) note the difficulty some students face in secondary school when they have not had an underlying mathematical education that includes justification and argumentation (p. 234).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, we can see a research-supported change in the way  proof and proving is approached in K-12. We see the idea that argumentation and justification are practices students need throughout their mathematics education rather than being introduced to &quot;proofs&quot; as an activity late in their public school education. Additionally, that these practices support students in learning &quot;proof&quot; later on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The chapters in Stylianou, Blanton and Knuth (2009) make the argument for the broadening of the notion of proof, and are a much more detailed look at how and why researchers are seeing the need for this perspective change. This doesn't argue against Euclidean proof, but I think it does argue against that being the first introduction to the idea of proving, and of the practice of justification as an inherent part of knowing in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDENDUM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I checked, and there is proof used to &quot;refute or support conjectures&quot; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nctm.org/standards/content.aspx?id=3956#analyze&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;9-12 Geometry Standard of the NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics.&lt;/a&gt; (Link is behind a paywall)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cited&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.

I'll give it a go.  The difficulty in doing so is that &quot;geometric diagram&quot; is quite general and without more focus it's hard to give specific ideas on how to draw diagrams.  So rather than give explicit examples, I'll link to a some questions on TeX-SX to whet your appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, though, let me try to explain why I use TikZ for &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; (including my kids' birthday invitations).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familiarity.&lt;/strong&gt; This can't be understated.  I want to get a drawing drawn with minimum fuss, so I've learnt TikZ/PGF and know it well and don't want to learn another system for a minor advantage.  That is to say, any advantage a different system would give me for a &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; diagram would be vastly outweighed by the time it would take to get familiar with the new system.  So since TikZ works very well for the majority of my diagrams, it is what I use for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the basic argument for using LaTeX.  You Get What You Want, not what you see or what you can get away with.  If you want a line to be &lt;em&gt;just there&lt;/em&gt; then you program it to be &lt;em&gt;just there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision.&lt;/strong&gt; Goes hand-in-hand with &quot;control&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computation.&lt;/strong&gt; As TikZ is built on top of TeX, it can actually run algorithms and make decisions based on those.  It may not be the fastest programming language in existence, but it does mean that you can do stuff all in one place.  The &lt;em&gt;Penrose tiles&lt;/em&gt; link below is an example of this, as is my package(s) for drawing knots and links where it can work out the intersections and draw them as you want them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration.&lt;/strong&gt; If you already write your documents in LaTeX, TikZ allows you to design them inside that document so that you get a consistent look through the whole document.  Plus using styles means that you can maintain consistency across documents.  Externalisation means that once a diagram is worked out, the document can be compiled without needing to recompute the diagram every time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me now list a few samples on TeX-SX.  The selection is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; biased.

I have been recognized for my teaching by Math for America (I have been a “Master Teacher” for eight or so years now), am locally respected (sorry, no data to support that) and have loved my job for all of these years. Now I find that the nutty wacky whims of the Department of Education under Bloomberg and Klein have been dwarfed by NYS and the federal government’s desire to implement truly difficult standards in a matter of months. We (teachers) are required to write curriculum based on almost NO information, tailor said curriculum to testing about which there are NO data, and still teach our five classes of 34 students a day without skipping a beat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I imagine you are thinking, why do you need to tailor curriculum to tests, especially if the tests don’t even exist yet? Sure, it has something to do with our jobs being on the line if our students don’t surpass some standard or other (sorry, but to us it all seems just so very arbitrary), but more to the point, no reform means anything until you see what assessment is going to be. We are accustomed to writing our curricula by determining what it is we want our students to be able to do and then designing activities and lessons to convey those expectations and to train students to accomplish goals. It would be duplicitous for the powers that be to withhold those expectations from us if they were even close to having established them, but we are all too aware that, unfortunately, Pearson and others are scrambling madly to write tests (for billions and billions of dollars) that they have no time to field test, which has already resulted in chaos and utter confusion in lower grades in NY State. My colleagues and I have NO problem holding students to high standards as long as those standards are clearly conveyed to us and as long as we have time to develop appropriate curricula and activities. (We would have used the summer to do this if the standards had been available before September — not happily, but we would have done so.) The current situation is diametrically opposed to that. And I must reiterate my disappointment that The Times, the only paper of record as far as I am concerned, totally missed the point: that parents and students and educators are ALL up in arms about the Common Core, not just extremist politicians on both sides, because to us, the Common Core standards are not even standards. They are vague ideas being developed (for huge personal profit) by billionaires and testing companies, imposed upon teachers, students and parents with complete disregard for education, learning and progress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2014-04-30T14:04:30.330" CommentCount="3" />

I understand this notation is fairly standard later on and elsewhere, but before a student really understands inverse functions, I think it's best to remove the potential opportunity to conflate these two completely different concepts that happen to share notation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A professor of mine used &quot;push-forward&quot; and &quot;pull-back&quot; to refer to &quot;image&quot; and &quot;preimage&quot; and, the more I think about it, the more I really like those terms and want to use them (almost) exclusively myself. They really convey the &lt;em&gt;operational&lt;/em&gt; aspect of the definitions: there's a function that does something, and we care about where it &lt;em&gt;pushes&lt;/em&gt; domain elements (for the image) or where it &lt;em&gt;pulls back&lt;/em&gt; to domain elements (for the preimage). Perhaps using these two terms in tandem with the standard terms will really tie the ideas together more coherently for students.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I like your example about measurements and observations, but I would recommend using even &lt;em&gt;simpler&lt;/em&gt; examples, both of the arbitrary/abstract and applied varieties. Specifically, use some examples to show &quot;surprising&quot; behavior of the preimage operator. For instance, you can construct quickly (with students' help, even) a toy example to show that &quot;the preimage of an image of a set is not necessarily equal to the starting set&quot;. Draw some schematic diagrams with dots and arrows. Then, draw a graph of a function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ and ask about preimages of certain intervals on the $y$-axis: Where are all the $x$-values whose output &quot;lands in&quot; this set?

I benefited a lot from my wife's experience as a math-friendly biologist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main point of the course is to get students able to deal with &lt;em&gt;quantitative models.&lt;/em&gt; For example, my wife studied the movement of cells under various circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A common model postulates that the average distance $d$ between two&#xA;  positions of a cell at times $t_0$ and $t_0+T$ is given by &#xA;  $$d = \alpha T^\beta$$ where $\alpha&amp;gt;0$ is a speed parameter and&#xA;  $\beta\in[\frac12,1]$ is a parameter that measures how the movement&#xA;  fits between a Brownian motion ($\beta=\frac12$)&#xA;  and a purely ballistic motion ($\beta=1$). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This simple model is a great example to show how calculus can be relevant to biology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first point might be specific to recent French students: first-year students are often not even proficient enough with basic algebraic manipulations to be able to do anything relevant with such a model. For example, even asking to compute how $d$ changes when $T$ is multiplied by a constant needs to now how to &lt;strong&gt;deal with exponents&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, we even had serious issues with the mere use of percentages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the main point of our new calculus course is to be able to &lt;strong&gt;estimate uncertainties&lt;/strong&gt;: in particular, given that $T=T_0\pm \delta T$, $\alpha=\alpha_0\pm\delta\alpha$ and $\beta=\beta_0\pm\delta\beta$, we ask them to estimate $d$ up to order one (i.e. using &lt;strong&gt;first-order Taylor series&lt;/strong&gt;). This already involves &lt;strong&gt;derivatives of multivariable functions&lt;/strong&gt;, and is an important computation when you want to draw conclusions from experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another important point of the course is the &lt;strong&gt;use of logarithms and exponentials&lt;/strong&gt;, in particular to interpret log or log-log graphs. For example, in the above model, it takes a (very) little habit to see that taking logs is a good thing to do: $\log d = \beta\log T+\log \alpha$ so that plotting your data in log-log chart should give you a line (if the models accurately represent your experiments).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This then interacts with &lt;strong&gt;statistics&lt;/strong&gt;: one can find the &lt;strong&gt;linear regression&lt;/strong&gt; in log-log charts to find estimates for $\alpha$ and $\beta$. But then one really gets an estimate of $\beta$ and... $\log\alpha$, so one should have a sense of how badly this uncertainty propagates to $\alpha$ (&lt;strong&gt;one variable first-order Taylor series&lt;/strong&gt;: easy peasy).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other main goal of the course is to get them able to deal with some (ordinary) differential equations. The motivating example I chose was offered to me by the chemist of our syllabus meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A common model for the kinetics of a chemical reaction&#xA;$$A + B \to C$$&#xA;is the second-order model: one assumes that the speed of the reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the species A and B. This leads to a not-so-easy differential equation of the form&#xA;$$ y'(t) = (a-y(t))(b-y(t)).$$&#xA;This is a &lt;strong&gt;first-order ODE with separable variables&lt;/strong&gt;. One can solve it explicitly (a luxury!) by dividing by the second member, &lt;strong&gt;integrate&lt;/strong&gt; in $t$, do a &lt;strong&gt;change of variable&lt;/strong&gt; $u=y(t)$ in the left-hand-side, &lt;strong&gt;resolve into partial fractions&lt;/strong&gt; the rational fraction that comes out, and remember how log is an &lt;strong&gt;antiderivative&lt;/strong&gt; of the inverse function (and how to adjust for the various constants the appeared in the process). Then, you need some &lt;strong&gt;algebraic manipulations&lt;/strong&gt; to transform the resulting equation into the form $y(t) = \dots$. Unfortunately and of course, we are far from being able to properly cover all this material, but we try to get the student able to follow this road later on, with their chemistry teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, I would love to be able to do more quantitative analysis of differential equations, but it is difficult to teach since it quickly goes beyond a few recipes. For example, I would like them to become able to tell in a glimpse the &lt;strong&gt;variations&lt;/strong&gt; of solutions to&#xA;$$y'(t)=a\cdot y(t)-b \sqrt{y(t)}$$&#xA;(a model of population growth for colonies of small living entities organized in circles, where death occur mostly on the edge - note how basic &lt;strong&gt;geometry&lt;/strong&gt; makes an appearance here to explain the model) in terms of the initial value. Or to be able to realize that solutions to&#xA;$$y'(t)=\sqrt{y(t)}$$&#xA;must be sub-exponential (and what that even means...). For this kind of goals, one must first aim to basic proficiency in calculus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To sum up, &lt;strong&gt;dealing with any quantitative model needs a fair bit of calculus&lt;/strong&gt;, in order to have a sense of what the model says, to use it with actual data, to analyze experimental data, to interpret it, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To finish with a controversial point, it seems to me that, at least in my environment, biologists tend to underestimate the usefulness of calculus (and statistics, and more generally mathematics) and that improving the basic understanding of mathematics among biologists-to-be can only be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="187" LastActivityDate="2014-04-30T21:12:29.687" CommentCount="0" />

However, the way we went about them was strange, it really felt like symbol manipulation. We had a big list of axioms and postulates, and proofs were fairly mechanical. They were done by a table, one side was the result, the other was what you invoked to get it&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Result                |     Method&#xA;________________________________________________&#xA;1 Lycanthropy         |     Given&#xA;2 A cute bunny        |     Given&#xA;3 A werewolf rabbit   |     Flibbergoth's theorem of lycanthropic mammals on (1) and (2)&#xA;________________________________________________&#xA;∴ Wolf isomorphism    | The harewolf-lupine equivalence axiom on (3)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can see an actual, non-silly simple example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sparknotes.com/math/geometry3/geometricproofs/section1.rhtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I question whether or not this is a good way to introduce proof writing. Certainly the proofs that come out are valid (if done correctly). There's nothing inherently wrong, but even now they feel &lt;em&gt;foreign&lt;/em&gt; to me. I don't feel like I really got proofs until I took a discrete math course in college, where proofs were more free, we could choose our own approach, and we tended to write in paragraphs. Certainly we still invoked axioms and theorems and brought up givens, but it was much less structured and, for me, was easier to understand and perform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Full disclosure: we did introduce more freeform, paragraph-like proofs by contradiction near the end of the course, but it was introduced as a novelty and never used on any exams or homework).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I am not the world. I was wondering if there was evidence to support this method for introducing proofs. Is there any evidence that this improves mathematical reasoning, or is easier for students to learn and execute than more free-form proofs? Certainly it's a lot more similar to the mechanical symbol manipulation most students have been doing up to that point, and I can see an argument that while argumentation and mathematical creativity is still involved, providing the structure to make it more mechanical should make it easier to perform given their likely education up to that point. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, I can't shake that I had very little idea what was going on until I got to less structured looking proofs. What does the evidence say? Is introducing proofs in a more structured format helpful? Am I just atypical? I'll grant it's entirely possible I wouldn't have even understood freeform proofs if I hadn't done the structured approach first, but I still have trouble doing the same proofs in table format that I could do easily in a paragraph with sentences interspersed with notation, so I don't know. I've always personally had a more argumentative/wordy approach to doing math (post-arithmetic at least).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: As &lt;strong&gt;mweiss&lt;/strong&gt; indicated, &quot;effectiveness&quot; isn't very well defined.

Regardless of what level you're teaching, grades are important. They control scholarships and school admissions (be they undergrads or high school students). Doing poorly on an exam can be a death sentence to a grade, and that can mean a lot of bad things for a good student. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most students really, truly understand that it's better to understand the material. They really do, however, the grade comes this or next week. And that grade will have an influence (however minor on its own) on their academic career. If they need to understand something, they can reread the textbook over the summer. I always try for understanding, but there have certainly been times where I had to say &quot;okay, either I can try to deeply understand this and possibly fail or I can spend the next two days memorizing these special cases so I pass the final&quot;. It's unfortunate, but rational and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution really depends how much control you have over the course. Can you reduce some of the exams to weekly quizzes with less grade impact? That can be a good way to test basic competency and familiarity with the material without the grade pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely have to abide by the exam schedule (or it's external to your class e.g. a GRE prep or you're a tutor for someone else's course), you could make your tests require a deep understanding; structure questions as proofs and conceptual short answer questions. I do warn you, though, that this may backfire horribly for any number of reasons. Not the least of which is that it's hard to regularly and consistently make a large number of high quality conceptual questions that are really fair to beginners at a topic (often we become blind to the difficulty of conceptual questions about concepts we understand).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think this is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common question in all areas of education. &quot;How can I get students to try and understand instead of trying to min/max their chances of getting an A?&quot; And I don't think there's a perfect answer unless you're in a position to change the system.

Rather than attempt to address &quot;effectiveness&quot;, instead these studies address the qualitative question, &quot;How is the two-column form used?&quot;  For example, here is a paper I wrote with Patricio Herbst and Chia-ling Chen:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weiss, M., Herbst, P., and Chen, C.  (2009)  &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10649-008-9144-2&quot;&gt;Teachers' perspectives on 'Authentic Mathematics' and the two-column proof form.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Educational Studies in Mathematics&lt;/em&gt;, 70(3), 275-293.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few excerpts from that paper, which include citations to other relevant studies for this question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This paper explores geometry teachers’ perspectives on how the two-column proof form can be both a resource and a constraint in engaging students in proving. The two-column form has been used in the USA to teach students how to do proofs since early in the twentieth century (Herbst 2002a). But the two-column form has been criticized for perpetrating a formalistic image of proving, and calls for reform in the 1980s (NCTM 1989) had recommended that teachers decrease attention to two-column proving. In this article we examine a counterproposal that emerges from listening to teachers: namely, that the two- column form can actually be productive when engaging students in proving, by acting not only a constraint, but also a resource enabling complex and non-linear reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and from later:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;American geometry students often learn to write proofs by way of a numbered sequence of “Statements” and “Reasons” in parallel columns (Sekiguchi 1991). This form of writing proofs is quite different from how mathematicians ordinarily write their proofs (Lamport 1995; Schoenfeld 1988; Wu 1996). The two-column form of “statements” and “reasons” has been the standard for the writing￼of proofs since early in the twentieth century. Herbst (2002a, b; Herbst et al. 2008) has argued that this form, as it is deployed in the high school geometry course, is not merely a special way of recording a finished proof; in common classroom practice the two-column form is both a symbol of, and a tool for, a customary way of engaging students in proving. In most classrooms, a proof in two-column form is written out in a chronological sequence that correlates with the numbered assertions: line 1 is written first, line 2 is written second, and so on. Moreover, the two columns are written in alternating sequences: first the statement of line 1, then the reason for line 1; then the statement for line 2, then the reason for line 2; and so on. This turn-taking structure facilitates the teacher in engaging many students in the construction of a single proof. Thus it is not the case that a proof argument is developed first, and only later &lt;em&gt;recorded&lt;/em&gt; in the two-column form; rather, the two-column form becomes a structure that scaffolds the &lt;em&gt;crafting of the argument itself&lt;/em&gt;. More than a final summary of the reasoning, it often amounts to a chronological narrative of the development of the argument. For this reason, dispositions important for the working mathematician, such as working backwards, mapping a strategy, or structuring a proof, are poorly accommodated in the way geometry classes tend to use the two-column format (see Anderson 1982; Greeno 1980; Herbst 2002b; Leron 1983; Thurston 1994).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you may be able to gather from those excerpts, most people who look at the teaching of proof are pretty critical of the two-column form, arguing that it puts too much emphasis on form rather than substance, and that it is an inauthentic representation of what mathematicians actually do when they prove.  Given this, one might wonder why the two-column form has stuck around as long as it has.  Patricio Herbst traced the evolution of this form and its gradual establishment as a norm over time, and argued that the 2CF made it possible for teachers to hold students accountable for learning to write proofs -- in effect, it solved a problem of teaching.  His paper is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Herbst, P. G.

The form can function as either a straightjacket or as a safety net, depending on how it is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29" LastActivityDate="2014-05-01T02:08:45.177" CommentCount="1" />

For example, calculus students think that the sole objective of calculus sometimes is learning how to differentiate polynomials by hand. That's part of it, but there are many other things you want students to be able to do, both computational and conceptual. If you lay these things out for them in the form of unambiguous, action verb-oriented learning objectives and then make those objectives clear to students, maybe they will see that what they know (or think that they know) is just a small subset of what needs to be known. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example: Here's my learning objective list for the section on the Chain Rule (section 2.5 in Matt Boelkins' &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html&quot;&gt;Active Calculus&lt;/a&gt; book): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Review&lt;/em&gt;) Apply all the derivative rules from Sections 2.1--2.4 with fluency. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Review&lt;/em&gt;) Identify composite functions (that is, functions of the form (y = f(g(x)))) and identify the “inner” and “outer” functions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;State the Chain Rule and explain how it works in English. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Identify situations where the Chain Rule should be used when taking a derivative. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a simple composite function, for example a composition of a polynomial and a power function (e.g.,  $f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)^{1/2}$).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite function involving two (more complex)  functions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite function involving three or more functions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use the Chain Rule in combination with other rules from earlier in this chapter. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use the Chain Rule to differentiate a composite function in which at least one of the functions in the composite is given as a graph or a table of values. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I run calculus in a flipped classroom model and as such, students get these learning objectives when they are assigned the pre-class exercises to do prior to the class meeting on the chain rule -- so the students know what the learning objectives are. Students from a garden-variety AP Calculus course in high school probably have seen 2/3 of these objectives and are fluent with maybe 1/2 of them. What they need to notice is that there are some objectives that are not simple, like the last couple. Just knowing what needs to be known is a prerequisite for noticing that you don't really know it all yet. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second: Use lots of formative assessment during class to give nearly-live updates to students on what they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; know -- short individual exercises, group quizzes, clicker questions, etc. that are aimed at common tasks and common misconceptions. Students say that they know more than they do because for many of them knowledge is a &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; rather than an objective fact. Give them data about what they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; know and their feelings should fall into line.

I've taken College Algebra classes three times at three different levels and schools due to unusual circumstances. To make things even more interesting, I started out as an English Lit major, and later became a computer programmer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, you have already realized that confronting the students in an aggressive manner on the first day sets you against them, and challenges them to &quot;prove&quot; that you're wrong. If you walk over to the English department you may overhear a saying popular in creative writing classes. Don't tell me, show me. One of the most common mistakes in amateur writing is to tell the reader how a person feels, rather than showing the emotion through action and description.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would submit that telling a math student that the high school class taken does not give them a complete understanding of algebra is a &quot;tell me&quot; rather than &quot;show me&quot; approach. The difference between knowledge and wisdom lies in the ability to apply knowledge to relevant situations at hand. Thus, the person who truly understands algebra is the one who can apply it successfully. In the understandably academic environment of college, I believe that sometimes gets lost. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my first college algebra class, I decided to look for a tutor and found a junior who was pursuing mechanical engineering. He impressed me in the first tutoring session by drawing out pictures of various engineering principles and how the equations and expressions in my textbook were useful for describing these actions. It was the first practical application anyone had ever shown me, and it completely rocked my perspective of mathematics. This guy understood how to apply the concepts, not just how to memorize or regurgitate them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider providing scenarios that can be solved by a correct understanding of the math rather than only providing equations to solve in familiar formats. Many students who memorized formulas will find that they struggle to apply their rote memorization to real world situations. Likewise, you may also discover a select few who genuinely do grasp the meaning and value of the principles they learned in high school classes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, I would propose that the value of the high school class they took is that it provided enough context and common language to begin having the discussions you will initiate at the college level. If the only conversation occurring is how well the student has memorized a particular fact or method, then both student and teacher have missed out on valuable interaction. In my opinion, your greatest opportunity is to affect the student's worldview and perspective of math, which is also where the greatest gap exists between teacher and student. I am proof that perspective can still be changed at the college level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are passionate about your craft, and you know how to apply it, then show them why it matters and what can be done with it. That alone should be enough for anyone who is humble to recognize their own limitations. Much like the difference between sharpshooting and hunting, algebra is a mathematical tool that in and of itself has little value until it is applied in some way for a useful purpose, usually to produce information that can be acted upon. It is the surprise of seeing a master do something previously unrecognized as possible or relevant that makes a novice realize and admit how little they really do know about a subject. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1344" LastActivityDate="2014-05-01T21:50:30.473" CommentCount="1" />

I and my daughters use this stuff all the time to make small, semi-durable objects. The firm version is a little tougher to work with (like heavy clay), but it holds its shape very well while curing. You could make a jig of some sort with the shape you want, cut off the approximate amount of Sculpey, force it into the jig, unmold, then bake. Possibly paint and lacquer as a finishing step. This is what I would do if I needed cuboid dice tomorrow (I keep this stuff on hand for crafting and object-making).&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prettygamer.com/2010/09/arts-crafts-with-sculpey-how-to-make.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here's a &quot;How To&quot;&lt;/a&gt; for making stylized dice out of the stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Making the dice: In thinking about the &quot;jig&quot; I'm not sure there is an easy way to do that. Perhaps a better method would be to use flat surfaces to form the dice. Start by cutting off the Sculpey from the block at the approximate size and shape you want. Weigh the thing with a decent scale that gives you fractions of grams so that you can more reliably make a second one of the approximate same size. Weight is going to be more helpful than anything else here. Then, use flat surfaces to gently square off the sides (it should already be the approximate cuboid shape when you cut it). Be gentle, so as not to deform it. Once you have the desired number of dice, bake. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="759" LastEditorUserId="759" LastEditDate="2014-05-02T12:01:35.273" LastActivityDate="2014-05-02T12:01:35.273" CommentCount="3" />

For example, while online learning might initially seem more difficult than DGS, it is far more readily available nowadays to anyone with a computer and internet connection (e.g. Khan Academy, Coursera, etc.) than classroom DGS. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to online learning, here are the &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; resources a school needs in order to effectively reach DGS level 3 or 4:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;School computers and internet connection&lt;/strong&gt;.

Subsequently, use the course final as at most half of the student's grade; in particular, it can be worth more than half of the grade if the score is &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; than the average going into the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set the total number of points for a course at $N$ and allow for some fixed number of points that can be earned during the semester (through examinations, quizzes, etc).

(Just be sure not to scare any students with a more shaky understanding)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You then need to confront them with reality, not by head butting them but by reviewing, you quickly review what you think they know, constantly testing they do actually understand the basic principals, and reassuring them that it is good they already know most of this stuff, until you hit the point where they become unsure.  You then change your language so that this is what they are going to learn and you give them a summary of what you are going to teach them.

(They also got a semester of statistics in another course.)  I looked at some of the second and third-year prescribed books for the pharmacy degree and they had quite a lot of calculus in them.  Physical pharmacy: rates of diffusion of various things.  Interpreting the elimination of a drug given orally from the body by looking at measurements in the blood at different times: the drug goes first into the stomach and then into the bloodstream, so you end up with two coupled DEs (or even three, if some organ or tissue is acting as a reservoir).  Chemistry: in pharmacy you are generally dealing with weak acids and weak alkalis, so the situation is considerably more complicated than in the usual beginning chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certainly things like semi-log plots occurred quite a lot - not exactly calculus, but often taught with it.  And we did teach the trapezoidal rule!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There wasn't any other maths/stats as such except the two one-semester courses in the Pharmacy program.   They did a lot of chemistry and biology, and specialised courses on Pharmacy topics.  This course was in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm a bit surprised at the Pharmacology major mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I would say that anyone who is good at both maths and biology has got some fantastic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1361" LastActivityDate="2014-05-03T07:42:39.927" CommentCount="0" />

For example, in physics, systems with certain symmetries are the easiest to model (e.g., an infinite plane, an infinitely long cylinder, a sphere, etc.).  But we have to be careful here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Stewart_%28mathematician%29&quot;&gt;Ian Stewart&lt;/a&gt; has a very nice article on symmetry-breaking.  (The article is from his column in &lt;em&gt;Pour La Science&lt;/em&gt; and was reprinted as &quot;Curie's Mistake&quot; Chapter 10 of &lt;em&gt;Another Fine Math You've Got Me Into...&lt;/em&gt; (New York: W. H. Freeman and Company, 1992).)  Aside from presenting examples of symmetry found in nature, he also presents examples in nature where symmetry breaks (like why certain animals have stripes and why others have spots).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stewart discusses the question &quot;How does the symmetry of a system affect its behavior?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A famous answer was given by the great physicist Pierre Curie [...].  In 1894 Pierre Curie gave two logically equivalent statements of a general principle from the folklore of mathematical physics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;If certain causes produce certain effects, then the symmetries of the causes reappear in the effects produced.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;If certain effects reveal a certain asymmetry, this asymmetry will be reflected in the causes which give rise to them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stewart then goes to see if Curie was correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For example, in the Kensington Science Museum in London there is an engineering model of a passenger jet, used in a wind tunnel to study the flow of air around the aircraft.  Since the aircraft is bilaterally symmetric, the engineers built only half of the model---tacitly assuming that the air flow had to be bilaterally symmetric as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Curie was not correct.  There are many instances in nature where symmetry breaks, instances where a symmetric state becomes unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="77" LastEditorUserId="77" LastEditDate="2014-05-03T07:51:02.317" LastActivityDate="2014-05-03T07:51:02.317" CommentCount="1" />

However, as an early example it could be useful as it takes you outside the world of things which are necessarily finite. Also, if your goal is to expose students to abstract examples, to take them outside their comfort zone, then it's probably a nice idea. So it depends on your audience. What kind of student are you challenging? Can they accept a challenge or do they need to stay closer to the world which they already have experience? The word problem, the problem of deciding if two presentations are equivalent is a bit unsettling to students who want cut and dried answers of how to solve problems. In short, it seems to me a few free groups in your lexicon of examples adds a certain depth to the course which is nice. Especially for those students who go on to work with free groups in later courses. That said, using only free groups introduces needless technical complications that would obfuscate the true geometric origin of many examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="128" LastActivityDate="2014-05-03T22:12:20.527" CommentCount="0" />
